	<p class="Chapter-Name"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"></a>Life Without <br />Trapped Emotions</p>
    <p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap-First-Paragraph">T</span>o live a life completely free of trapped emotions would truly be a wonderful thing. It might be achievable, but from what I have observed, there is rarely a person that does not get a trapped emotion from time to time. It seems to be part of the human experience.</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Life is a mixed bag, filled with blessings to be grateful for, difficulties to overcome, opportunities to explore, decisions to make, and grief and suffering at times. All of these things give us experience. They provide ways for us to exercise faith, gain knowledge and develop love. All of the human family is connected and everything that happens to one of us affects everyone to one degree or another. Through our experiences we have the opportunity to strengthen our connection by developing understanding and compassion for one another.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The way you decide to feel each day with all of the many things that you face will determine how life will flow for you. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Your attitude has tremendous bearing on what will present itself before you, on the opportunities that will come, and on what you will learn. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">In reality, you attract much of what you see before you because of what you believe you can have in your life. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Your Focus Determines Reality</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The choice is there each new day, to feel good or to feel bad about the things that are going on in your life. There are almost always both good and not-so-good things happening at any given time. What you choose to focus on is a big factor in the happiness equation. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Sometimes people put too much focus on the past. If you choose to focus your mind on a negative event from your past and re-experience those emotions, you can actually create a trapped emotion about that event, even long after it has happened.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">One particular patient named Diane comes to mind in this regard. Diane’s father had died 10 years previously, yet I found a trapped emotion of sorrow about his death that she had created 4 years after he died. While she had made it through his funeral without creating any trapped emotions, she had chosen to allow the negative emotion of sorrow to overcome her on the fourth anniversary of his death. At that time, she had made a conscious decision to re-experience her loss and sorrow, instead of thinking about the wonderful and positive things that her father represented to her. The result was a negative and potentially dangerous trapped emotion. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Stop for a moment and think about your own thoughts. During any given day of your life, do your thoughts tend to be more positive or more negative? Do you choose to dwell on favorable, positive things and decide to feel grateful, content and joyful or do you choose to dwell on </span><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idIndexMarker011"></a></span><span class="Drop-Cap">negative emotions? </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">If you are in a troubled relationship, for example, there are almost always a number of good things that you </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">can</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> think of that you appreciate in your partner. Focusing on the good things about a relationship and giving your attention to its positive aspects can help to create gratitude and happiness for you. To do so may even open a way to create positive change, especially if it is your intention to build and preserve the relationship. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">By contrast, whenever we place our focus on our problems and on the things that are going wrong in our lives, we end up creating more negativity. I saw a movie once where a wise teacher told his student, “Remember, your focus determines your reality.” How true that statement really is! You can see a glass as being half-full or half-empty, but seeing the glass as half-full is more empowering and will create a more positive reality for you. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"></a>The Law of Attraction</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Feeling positive emotions about what you want will literally help you to create your dreams. When you visualize your life the way you want it to be and feel the way that it feels as if you already had your dream, you will eventually find opportunities to create the things that make you happy right in front of you.</span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Focusing on the things that you don’t want and feeling negatively will either create or perpetuate those same negative problems in your life. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">For example, if you spend your time thinking about how you can’t seem to find love, the signal you are sending out to the universe is that you can’t find love. As a result, you won’t find it, or it will at least be more difficult to find.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">We are constantly radiating our thoughts into the cosmos. I believe that these thoughts fill the immensity of space, and that they are not limited by the speed of light or any other limitation. Our thoughts are powerful, and what we think and feel is what we create. Remember Proverbs 23:7, “As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Creation is always happening. Every time an individual has a thought, or a prolonged, chronic way of thinking, they’re in the creation process. Something is going to manifest out of those thoughts... And so you end up attracting to you the predominant thoughts that you’re holding in your awareness, whether those thoughts are conscious or unconscious.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">- Rev. Michael Beckwith</span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-14"><span id="footnote-004-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="The_Emotion_Code_Print_rev_Nov_2015.html#footnote-004">1</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">You may already understand the importance of controlling your conscious thoughts, and keeping those conscious thoughts in a positive vein. But what about your subconscious thoughts? </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Your subconscious mind can have a very great effect on the outcomes that you are trying to achieve in your life. Trapped emotions work their negative influence on you in large part through the mechanism of your subconscious mind. You may be trying your best to think positively and see the glass as half-full, while your subconscious trapped emotions are betraying you by constantly radiating their own particular negative thought-frequencies into the universe. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The more trapped emotions you have, the more negative thought-energy they are radiating, and the more difficult it will be to attract what you really want. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The good news is that trapped emotions can be released. When you make a habit of using the Emotion Code regularly, you will be able to avoid the damage that occurs on a subconscious level of thinking and feeling because you will be changing your thought-frequencies. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When you free yourself of negative trapped emotions, you will find it easier to choose the positive emotions that will help you to attract  what you really want in your life. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"></a>You Choose Your Emotions</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Have you ever made a statement like, “My husband makes me so mad…” or “That made me so depressed…” or “That put me in such a bad mood”? Statements like these are very common. If you listen to yourself more closely you might catch yourself saying something similar. If you stop and think about statements like these, you will realize they’re quite ridiculous. The fact is that nobody can </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">make</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> you feel any emotion that you don’t </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">choose</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> to feel. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Things that happen </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">to</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> you do not really determine the emotions that you feel. While you may not have conscious control over all of the events that affect your life, you do have the ability to choose how you think, feel, and act. No matter what happens, you ultimately choose the emotions that you feel. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Many of us unwittingly become victim to our emotions at times. You may not believe that you are in control of how you feel. Negative emotions can emerge so quickly that it may appear as if there is no time to choose a different emotion than the natural reactive emotion that just seems to come out of nowhere. If you are late for an appointment, you may automatically feel anxious. If someone treats you rudely, you might automatically feel miffed. When you are insulted or abused, you may immediately feel resentful or angry in response. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">If you are like most people, unacceptable things happen from time to time. Unless you take control of your emotions, you will simply react. When you allow yourself to react, your subconscious mind may offer up a negative emotion for you, based upon the emotions you have chosen in similar circumstances in your past. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">While you may have always responded in a certain negative way to a given situation, your past negative responses do not have to be the same as your future responses. You have a choice every time you need to deal with or confront something negative. You can choose to react how you have always reacted or you can choose differently. The past does not have to equal the future.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The reality about emotions is that you </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">always</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> choose them. You always choose how you feel. Always. Becoming aware of this is in itself quite empowering. You are the author of your own emotional experiences.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">You can choose whatever emotion you want in any situation you are faced with. It takes some practice, and it’s not always easy, but it can be done. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The next time you find yourself filled with a negative emotion, stop and think about the process you went through to arrive at that feeling. It might seem like the emotion chose you, but you really did choose the emotion. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Making a conscious choice instead of allowing old subconscious patterns to run you is choosing to evolve and grow. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Using your new knowledge and awareness of trapped emotions will help you to be able to stop and think before letting an automatic response get the best of you. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The next time you are faced with a negative situation, don’t simply react. Think! Ask yourself, “Which will serve me better, a negative emotion or a positive emotion?” My guess is that positivity will usually win. There are all kinds of great ways you can choose to feel. Here’s a list of positive emotions that you can use the next time you want to choose positively.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Positive Emotions List</p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"></a>About Letting Go</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">In the book “Man’s Search for Meaning” the importance of choosing your own emotions instead of allowing negativity to choose you is illustrated very well. Dr. Victor Frankl was a psychologist who was sent to a concentration camp by the Nazis during the Second World War. As a student of human behavior, Dr. Frankl naturally began to observe the people around him. People’s reactions to their predicament and the horrors they observed around them varied widely. Dr. Frankl found that those people that chose the emotion of hopelessness, and who simply gave up did not survive for long. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">To his surprise, Dr. Frankl found that in the midst of indescribable horror there were still those individuals that chose emotions of love and hope. He wrote:</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">“We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"></a>About Pride</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When you hear the word pride, what do you think of? Pride in an accomplishment? Pride in a job well done? Perhaps you think of pride in your athletic team or pride in being the citizen of a certain country. While all of these kinds of pride are probably quite all right, there is another kind of pride that is insidious and damaging.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The kind of pride that hurts us is sometimes called false pride. It is when we put ourselves in a state of opposition to others or to God. It is when we feel hatred, jealousy, resentment, superiority, ill will, or anger toward another. False pride is selfish. It can be like a temper tantrum, when our way is the best and only way. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">False pride is often very difficult to recognize in ourselves; it has been called “the great vice” because it is so common among people. One of the real problems with this kind of pride is that it makes you unwilling to forgive others. Instead, pride makes you want to hold on to the real or imagined hurts you have suffered, and leads you to all </span><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idIndexMarker012"></a></span><span class="Drop-Cap">kinds of negative emotions such as anger, frustration and resentment. Eventually you may end up wanting revenge on those who may have wronged you. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When we pit our own will in resistance against others or against God or the Universe, we steal our own power. The source of all power is God; if we are working against Him we paralyze ourselves and stop our progress. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">In reality, allowing false pride to persist in your life only thwarts your own progress and hurts you. Pride of this sort leads to the creation of trapped emotions, because it does not allow you to let go and forgive; it does not allow you to access a higher path that leads toward peace. Instead, pride leads down the dark road of negative feelings, usually beginning with a feeling of resentment. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Anger will never disappear so long as thoughts of resentment are cherished in the mind. Anger will disappear just as soon as thoughts of resentment are forgotten.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">- Buddha.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"></a>About Forgiveness</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">It is so important to realize that letting go of old hurt feelings helps </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">you</span><span class="Drop-Cap">. You may think that you are justified in holding on to hurt feelings because it punishes those that hurt you. In reality, holding on to </span><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idIndexMarker013"></a></span><span class="Drop-Cap">negative emotions hurts </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">you</span><span class="Drop-Cap">, not them. They may or may not be aware of how you feel, but the way </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">they</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> feel is entirely up to them. Just because you choose to suffer by holding onto the past doesn’t mean they will suffer along with you. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">They may have truly done something horrible. It may seem impossible to let it go. This is where you have power to do something meaningful that can be life changing, especially for you. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">You can decide to forgive them, thus freeing yourself  of all of the negativity associated with the problem. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I’ve always liked this quote by Lewis Smedes, “To forgive is to set a prisoner free and then discover that the prisoner was you.” So why not set yourself free? Why create more negativity and more damage by feeding your hurt feelings year after year? </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Have a mind to let things go. Forgive. Problems happen so often out of ignorance. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">So much human suffering is because we don’t know what we do to one another. If only we could understand that what we do to others, we do to ourselves.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">If you’ve been mistreated, think of the example left for us by Jesus Christ, who said these words as he was being nailed to the cross, “Father, forgive them for they know not what they do.” In his extremity, he chose the emotion of love and forgiveness, and we can, too. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">A true-life example of the power of forgiveness made national news in 2005. Columnist Jay Evensen tells the story: </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">How would you feel toward a teenager who decided to toss a 20-pound frozen turkey from a speeding car headlong into the windshield of the car you were driving? How would you feel after enduring six hours of surgery using metal plates and other hardware to piece your face together, and after learning you still face years of therapy before returning to normal—and that you ought to feel lucky you didn’t die or suffer permanent brain damage?</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">And how would you feel after learning that your assailant and his buddies had the turkey in the first place because they had stolen a credit card and gone on a senseless shopping spree, just for kicks? . . . </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">This is the kind of hideous crime that propels politicians to office on promises of getting tough on crime. It’s the kind of thing that prompts legislators to climb all over each other in a struggle to be the first to introduce a bill that would add enhanced penalties for the use of frozen fowl in the commission of a crime.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">The New York Times quoted the district attorney as saying this is the sort of crime for which victims feel no punishment is harsh enough. ‘Death doesn’t even satisfy them,’ he said.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Which is what makes what really happened so unusual. The victim, Victoria Ruvolo, a 44-year-old former manager of a collections agency, was more interested in salvaging the life of her 19-year-old assailant, Ryan Cushing, than in exacting any sort of revenge. She pestered prosecutors for information about him, his life, how he was raised, etc. Then she insisted on offering him a plea deal. Cushing could serve six months in the county jail and be on probation for 5 years if he pleaded guilty to second-degree assault.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Had he been convicted of first-degree assault—the charge most fitting for the crime—he could have served 25 years in prison, finally thrown back into society as a middle-aged man with no skills or prospects.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">But this is only half the story. The rest of it, what happened the day this all played out in court, is the truly remarkable part.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">According to an account in the New York Post, Cushing carefully and tentatively made his way to where Ruvolo sat in the courtroom and tearfully whispered an apology. ‘I’m so sorry for what I did to you.’</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Ruvolo then stood, and the victim and her assailant embraced, weeping. She stroked his head and patted his back as he sobbed, and witnesses, including a Times reporter, heard her say, ‘It’s OK. I just want you to make your life the best it can be.’ According to accounts, hardened prosecutors, and even reporters, were choking back tears.</span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-14"><span id="footnote-003-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="The_Emotion_Code_Print_rev_Nov_2015.html#footnote-003">2</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"></a>About Charity</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The ability to forgive others arises from our own ability to love. The purest form of love is unconditional love, also known as </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">charity</span><span class="Drop-Cap">. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">One of the most well-known scriptures from the New Testament is 1st Corinthians chapter 13, which reads in part:</span></p>
			<p class="Scripture-Quote"> 1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</p>
			<p class="Scripture-Quote"> 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</p>
			<p class="Scripture-Quote"> 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</p>
			<p class="Scripture-Quote"> 4 Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,</p>
			<p class="Scripture-Quote"> 5 Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;</p>
			<p class="Scripture-Quote"> 6 Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;</p>
			<p class="Scripture-Quote"> 7 Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>
			<p class="Scripture-Quote"> 8 Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">How can forgiving others and having charity help you to avoid getting trapped emotions?</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Charity is love, pure and simple. Unconditional love for our fellow-beings. I believe it’s really one of the most important reasons we are here on this earth; to learn to develop this kind of love. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When we feel this way toward others, our hearts resonate at the frequency of love, and we experience peace and harmony within. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">This frequency doesn’t allow room for any of the dark feelings that could create trapped emotions. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Charity helps us to get out of ourselves, to get beyond our own self-centeredness. It helps us to be more interested and understanding of the needs of others. It leads us to sacrifice of our time, service, and worldly goods to give to another in need. It helps us to become </span><span class="Drop-Cap"><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-17">givers</span></span><span class="Drop-Cap"> and grateful </span><span class="Drop-Cap"><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-17">receivers</span></span><span class="Drop-Cap"> rather than </span><span class="Drop-Cap"><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-17">takers</span></span><span class="Drop-Cap">. It creates a bond, a kinship, a brotherhood between us. It gives value to us as individuals, and gives us wholeness and a sense of belonging. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Charity, this pure love, is a gift from God, and emanates from the heart. Since it is a gift from God, we can ask Him for this gift, and we should. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When our hearts are filled with charity, we are turned outward, not inward. We find joy in helping to create happiness for others. Our concern for the welfare of others becomes as great a concern as our own happiness. We therefore create our own happiness by making worthwhile contributions to others and to society. Our hearts enlarge in a spiritual sense, becoming more capable of giving and receiving love. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Mother Teresa is universally admired for her service to mankind. She was asked how she could continue day after day, visiting the dying, feeding them, touching them, wiping their brows and comforting them.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">She said, “It’s not hard, because in each one I see the face of Christ in one of His more distressing disguises.”</span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When our hearts are full of charity, we are much less likely to develop trapped emotions. We are forgiving, patient, and kind. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Our tendency is to overlook the faults and weaknesses of others, rather than to judge them. A life full of charity is worth striving for and worth living. It is a life of positivity, a life that is high above the sea of </span><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idIndexMarker014"></a></span><span class="Drop-Cap">negative emotions below.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"></a>About Integrity</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When we live congruently with what we know to be right and true, we have integrity. Integrity is a virtue, an inner strength, an honesty with one’s self. Integrity drives people to be their best selves. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Generally, the more integrity we have, the less likely it is that we will develop trapped emotions because the soul is not divided, but is whole. There is no tearing of the heart, no conflict within. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When a person chooses to live in integrity, he is at peace with his own heart and mind. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When he continues on this path, integrity grows, confidence strengthens and positivity increases. A person living this way has little room for negative emotions that might become trapped.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Life, by its very nature, is uncomfortably challenging at times. We must meet those challenges by growing and going through change, so those with integrity are not exempt from trapped emotions entirely. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Personal growth requires stretching, adjusting, accommodating the needs of others, refining ourselves, taking risks, making difficult decisions, and doing more than we thought we could.  </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Adversity, opposition, and challenge certainly do give us the opportunity to grow. We can choose to resist and resent those challenges or welcome them as blessings, and feel gratitude for the growth they will bring to us. Sometimes the experiences that are the hardest to face, benefit us the most. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When we go through times of opposition, we may need to check ourselves for trapped emotions that might result, to stay free from their negative effects.  </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"></a>The Refiner’s Fire of Life </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Life is a learning and purifying process. There’s a story that illustrates this principle very well. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">There was once a group of women studying the book of Malachi in the Old Testament. As they were studying chapter three, they came across verse three, which says: “He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver.” This verse puzzled the women, and they wondered what this statement meant about the character and nature of God. One of the women offered to find out about the process of refining silver and get back to the group at their next Bible study.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">That week this woman called up a silversmith and made an appointment to watch him at work. She didn’t mention anything about the reason for her interest beyond her curiosity about the process of refining silver. As she watched the silversmith, he held a piece of silver over the fire and let it heat up. He explained that in refining silver, one needed to hold the silver in the middle of the fire where the flames were hottest as to burn away all the impurities.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">The woman thought about God holding us in such a hot spot </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-23">–</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> then she thought again about the verse, that he sits as a refiner and purifier of silver. She asked the silversmith if it was true that he had to sit there in front of the fire the whole time the silver was being refined.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">The man answered “Yes”, and explained that he not only had to sit there holding the silver, but he had to keep his eyes on the silver the entire time it was in the fire. If the silver was left even a moment too long in the flames, it would be damaged.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">The woman was silent for a moment. Then she asked the silversmith, “How do you know when the silver is fully refined?”</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">He smiled at her and answered, “Oh, that’s easy. When I see my image in it.”</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">If today you are feeling the heat of this world’s fire, just remember that God has His eyes on you.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">- Unknown</span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">If the trials of your life seem overwhelming to you, remember that God has a purpose for you and that you are loved. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">God is refining you. He will know you are finished with this process when He can see his own image when he looks into your face; when you have become like him in your ability to give unconditional love. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I believe that each of us has a destiny to fulfill, and a mission to perform while we are sojourning on this earth. Trapped emotions can contribute to illness and can prevent us from living the life we could be living. It is a sacred calling to help those who are suffering, not only because of themselves, but also because the ripple effects of their life, lived fully, can spread out through time and space to eternity. Some of the greatest satisfactions in my life have come from teaching people, bringing out the healer in them and practicing the healing art myself. As I do these things, I experience the joy that comes from empowering others and helping them to be well and happy.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"></a>About Prayer</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When I was a young man, I had a profound spiritual experience, in which I learned that God is real. I know that He lives and that He loves us all. We are His spirit children, brothers and sisters in a very literal sense. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Prayer has been an essential key for me in understanding who we as human beings really are,  how our bodies really function, how to correct problems and how to heal. It has been my custom to ask a silent prayer for guidance before attempting to help anyone who has come to me for help. Many times I have received understanding and inspiration that was beyond my own. I am grateful for this help, and I give the credit to God for it. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I strongly encourage you to ask God for help in all areas of your life, and especially in your attempts to help others. He will be there for you. You have only to believe and be grateful that He is helping you. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">In case you are not sure how to pray, or what format you might follow, I will share with you what has worked for me. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap"><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-17">I start by simply addressing God, usually by saying, “Heavenly Father”, as I believe He is my father. </span></span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap"><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-17">I next thank Him for the opportunity I have to help the person I am trying to help.</span></span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap"><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-17">Then, I ask Him for His help to do this, and for His insight and guidance. </span></span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap"><span class="Emphasis CharOverride-17">Lastly, I close my prayer in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen. The word Amen simply means, “so be it.”</span></span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">God bless you on your journey to getting well yourself. I hope that you will help many others along your way. I know that you can.</span></p>
