	<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap-First-Paragraph">T</span>rapped emotions can create a wall around your heart that can block you from living life to the fullest. I received this letter from a wonderful woman, a former patient of mine who had a Heart-Wall, once upon a time…</p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Living the Fairy Tale</p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">At the time Dr. Nelson cleared my Heart-Wall, I was approximately 51 years old and I had worked at the Walt Disney Company for 22 years. It was a busy, exciting career, filled with travel all over the world and bright, creative people. I had a wonderful family and many close friendships. I had never been married. I wasn’t against marriage nor was I dying to get married. It wasn’t an issue. My life was full.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Later that year, two of my friends were planning a trip to China. They asked me to join them, but I said I was very busy at work. They kept up their encouragement. It was as if an invisible hand was at my back, pushing me in the direction of China. Thinking that if I ever did want to go to China, I may as well go, I went.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Travel in China was somewhat restricted at the time, so we went with a group. There was a wonderful gentleman on the trip, an attorney who had been divorced for seven years. He lived in Newport Beach, about 40 miles from my home up the California coast. We got to know each other in a very unassuming way during our tour of China. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">On the airplane trip home, we sat together and he asked me out for the following weekend. We dated for a year. He popped the question on Thanksgiving Day and we were married six months later. I was age 53.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">As I reflect back on the time after my Heart-Wall cleared, I realize things weren’t the same. I began to open myself to the idea of having someone in my life “to have and to hold” and to care for as he would care for me. It happened on the feeling level. Finding someone to share my life with just felt like the next step. There was a new readiness that I hadn’t felt before. It must have been the removal of that invisible wall </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-23">–</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> that I had not even known was there </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-23">–</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> that allowed me to let this wonderful man in.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">So for all of you who think women cannot marry after “a certain age,” get your Heart-Wall cleared, stay open to the possibilities life has to offer and remember my story. We are now approaching our 5th anniversary, have just moved into our new home on the California Coast overlooking the ocean and Catalina Island and are living the fairy tale. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Thank you, Dr. Nelson.</span></p>

			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap">The Heart-Brain</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Your heart generates 60 to 1000 times more power and electromagnetic energy than your brain, easily making it the most powerful organ in your body. When you were in the womb, your heart was formed first, before your brain. Your heart beats about 100,000 times a day, 40 million times a year, and if its connection to your brain were severed, it would keep right on beating. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Your heart is the core of your being, the core of who you really are. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">New research shows that your heart is much more than a mere pump. In the 1970s, scientists learned that the heart has an elaborate nervous system, a discovery that has led to the creation of a new branch of medicine known as neurocardiology. The fact is, we all have </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">two</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> brains. Much to these scientists’ surprise, they discovered that the brains in our heads are </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">obeying</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> messages sent by “the brains in our hearts.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Your heart is constantly sending out information to your body. Every beat carries critical messages that affect your emotional and physical health. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When you feel love toward someone, you are actually sending out a powerful electromagnetic signal to them, using the heart brain. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Medical research experiments have repeatedly shown that there are measurable positive effects on the body when we feel love and appreciation toward someone else. The same beneficial affect occurs in your own body when you are on the receiving end – when love and appreciation are being broadcast toward you.</span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-14"><span id="footnote-007-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="The_Emotion_Code_Print_rev_Nov_2015.html#footnote-007">1</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Scientists have discovered that the electromagnetic signals radiating from your heart are actually detectable in the brain waves of another person. This phenomenon is strongest when two people are touching or are in close proximity but is measurable at a distance as well.</span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-14"><span id="footnote-006-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="The_Emotion_Code_Print_rev_Nov_2015.html#footnote-006">2</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">For several decades, medical science has had the remarkable ability to transplant organs from one person’s body to another. But remember the story of the World War II veteran and his blood cells. If a person’s individual cells keep their connection so strongly no matter where they are, think what a connection an entire organ must retain! We’ve all heard stories about transplant recipients who suddenly take an interest in a certain sport, or who have an unexplained craving for their donor’s favorite food. Heart transplant patients have reported these symptoms from the beginning, but doctors have had no way to understand it, so they attributed it to the patients’ imaginations. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Try telling that to the transplant patient who has never liked hot dogs or baseball, but who now can’t get enough of them since he received the heart of an avid White Sox fan. Or the woman who can’t keep from crying every time she hears a certain song, a song which meant nothing to her before her transplant. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The heart has its own unique intelligence. It can think, feel and remember.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">There is now considerable evidence that the heart contains memories and feelings. A large number of heart transplant recipients have reported new food and drink preferences and cravings, as well as handwriting changes, musical preferences, and memories that don’t seem to be their own.</span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-14"><span id="footnote-005-backlink"><a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="The_Emotion_Code_Print_rev_Nov_2015.html#footnote-005">3</a></span></span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap">The Discovery of the Heart-Wall</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Have you ever felt that you needed to “put up a wall” to protect yourself in a negative situation? It appears that this common phrase has a basis in reality. We call this phenomenon the “Heart-Wall”, and here is how we were led to discover it. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">In March of 1998, my wife Jean and I were in Portland, Oregon, attending a conference on magnetic healing where I was one of the guest speakers. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Early one morning, she woke me to say she’d had a powerful dream. She felt strongly that her dream had a deep meaning, and that it had something to do with her own health. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">In her dream, Jean saw a stainless steel order wheel like those found in restaurants and diners. She explained that the wheel had three orders clipped to it. She understood intuitively that each order represented a different issue having to do with her health. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Her subconscious mind knew the meaning of this dream, so I began muscle testing her, asking questions about the orders attached to the wheel. We quickly determined the meaning of the first two  health issues. When I turned my attention to the third order on the wheel, something completely unexpected happened.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Suddenly I had a waking vision. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I could see very clearly in my mind’s eye a beautiful, highly polished hardwood floor. Along with this vision came the understanding that Jean’s </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">heart</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> was </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">under</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> this floor! </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">This made no logical sense, but the image of this gleaming floor, and the perception that her heart was under it, were very persistent and clear. I determined to figure out what it all meant, if I could. I told Jean what I was seeing, and asked her if she had any insight into what this meant. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Well, last night I wasn’t feeling all that well, and Lana told me that she sensed there was some kind of energy over my heart. I wonder if that is what she was picking up.” My sister-in-law Lana is a Reiki Master, and a very gifted and intuitive healer. “I really don’t know what it means.” </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Fascinated, we began muscle testing to find out more about this hardwood flood. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“First, let’s find out how thick this floor is,” I said. “Is it one plank thick?”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Her arm was strong. The answer was “Yes.” </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Is it two planks thick?” “Yes.” </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“It is three planks thick?” “Yes.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Patiently, we went up by the numbers – five planks, ten planks, twenty, fifty, 100, 200 … Before long, I began asking about the thickness in feet. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Is this floor 100 feet thick?” “Yes.” </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Is it 500 feet thick?” “Yes.” </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">And on it went – 1000 feet, 2000 feet, 3000 feet, 4000 … “Is it 5000 feet thick?” “Yes.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Is this floor a mile thick?” “Yes.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Is it two miles, three miles, four miles thick?” “Yes, yes, yes.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Is this floor five miles thick?” “Yes.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Is this floor six miles thick?” “No.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">This was quite strange, and we couldn’t imagine what it meant. I was certain that it had some significant meaning, so I continued testing. It quickly became apparent that the hardwood floor I could see so clearly in my mind was exactly five miles thick. I had never had a waking vision like this before, yet the answers we were getting were very clear.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Three things were certain. I could see the floor vividly in my mind. I knew that in some symbolic way my wife’s heart was underneath this floor. The floor was very thick, five miles thick to be exact. What in the world could this possibly mean? </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I asked, “Is there a wall around your heart?” “Yes.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Is this wall five miles thick?” “Yes.” </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Is it made of wood?” “Yes.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">What exactly was this that we were in the process of discovering? Was it something of consequence? </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Quieting my mind for a moment led me to ask another question. “Is this wall made up of trapped emotions?”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Her arm was strong. The answer was “Yes.”</span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Suddenly the symbolic meaning became clear to me. I knew how vulnerable the human heart is to being hurt. I also knew Jean’s past. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Jean had been a sensitive and shy little girl. She had grown up in an imperfect, dysfunctional household like many of us do. While she has some wonderful memories, and while she loved her parents and siblings and knew they loved her, she didn’t feel safe emotionally. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">She could never predict what the emotional tone in her home might be from one moment to the next. Anger and harsh words frequently and suddenly erupted over things that should have been inconsequential. She and other family members would find themselves “walking on eggshells” at times like these. She never knew when she or someone else in the family might be lashed out at or blamed for something.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap">Protecting the Core of You</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">People deal with uncomfortable situations  such as these in many ways. Some attack, some retreat,  and some hide. But usually, we feel the need to defend and shield ourselves from being hurt. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Your heart is the core of your being. Your subconscious mind knows that it must protect your heart; it must protect your delicate core in any way it can. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Words like “heartache” and “heartbreak” are so-called because of the peculiar physical sensation that occurs in the heart under strong emotional strain. Nearly everyone has felt this sensation at one point or another. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Trapped emotions have substance. They consist of energy, just like everything else. When trapped emotions are created, they must reside somewhere in your body, and sometimes they will lodge in and around your heart. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Your subconscious mind – which knows no limitations – will sometimes use the energy of these trapped emotions to create a barrier or shield around your heart. Literally, it creates a wall of energy around your heart, to protect it. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">At first, I puzzled over this process until I realized that the subconscious mind most likely follows certain rules. For example, it is not possible to create a wall out of nothing. In the world in which we live, all things around us are made of energy, and I believe the subconscious mind understands this concept implicitly. All walls that exist in the physical world around us, regardless of the chosen building material, are ultimately made of energy. The Heart-Wall, created by the subconscious mind, is also made of energy. It just happens to be made of a specific sort of energy, the energy of trapped emotions. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I believe that to the subconscious mind, the Heart-Wall is as real as the chair you are sitting in. The Heart-Wall exists, it’s just on a slightly different plane of reality than the world we can see with our physical eyes. Does that make the Heart-Wall any less real? I don’t think so. Remember that we cannot see ultraviolet light or indeed, the vast majority of the electromagnetic spectrum, yet no one disputes its reality. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When I asked Jean’s body if we could release the trapped emotions that were making up this wall around her heart, the answer was “Yes.” </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Gradually, her body was willing to release these emotions. We found that the procedure for releasing emotions from the Heart-Wall was the same as for releasing any other trapped emotion. The only difference was that we had to ask specifically if we could release an emotion “from her Heart-Wall” in order to gain access to those emotions. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Each time we released a trapped emotion from Jean’s Heart-Wall, I would ask if we could release another emotion. Sometimes her body would allow us to clear more than one emotion in a single session, but often the answer was “No.” </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">It wasn’t surprising that her body needed a certain amount of time to process each of her emotions as they were released, so we patiently waited between sessions. We found that we were able to release a different trapped emotion roughly every other day until they were all gone, and Jean no longer had a Heart-Wall. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">The Creation of Her Heart-Wall</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Jean had learned to protect her feelings from  childhood. She retreated to safety inside of herself, shutting down her positive feelings, and avoiding connection with those that she felt vulnerable toward. When there were volatile episodes in her home,  she chose to feel fear, resentment and other negative emotions, some of which she expressed, but many that she internalized. Some of these feelings were never fully processed, and they became trapped  energies in her body. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">While she was consciously doing her best to deal with life, at the same time her subconscious was building a wall, an ultimate protection against her heart being injured again. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Her subconscious mind chose an imaginary wooden floor for her wall, specifically the hardwood that is walked upon. Do you see the symbolism there? The room she grew up in had a hardwood floor, as did much of her house back then, so it was a familiar sight. Her subconscious mind created her Heart-Wall at an early age, but it wasn’t completed for many years. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Each new trapped emotion gave her wall additional thickness and strength, until it was many thousands of feet thick. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">As we released the emotions from her Heart-Wall, we found that the thickness of the wall decreased. We could never predict how much of a decrease in thickness might result with the release of a trapped emotion. Some trapped emotions would result in a large decrease in thickness, some in a little. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When the last trapped emotion was released, something very interesting happened that helped Jean move beyond her past and the way that she perceived herself.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Getting Reconnected Again</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">While Jean’s Heart-Wall protected her heart from damage and hurt, this protection came at a cost. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Having a Heart-Wall left her feeling numb and somewhat isolated. She felt disconnected from others. She wanted to have close friends, and she tried many times, but something was always in the way. She was well-liked, but she found it hard to be at ease with people. She had many associations, but few close friends. In social gatherings, even with people she had known for many years, she invariably felt that she was on the outside looking in, and she was never able to feel like she truly belonged. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When the last trapped emotion was finally released, and her Heart-Wall was gone, there was a profound shift.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap"> “For the first time in my life, I’m not on the outside anymore,” she told me. “I’ve longed to feel this way my whole life. Now I know what it feels like to be part of a circle of friends, part of a group. It’s a very different feeling than I’ve ever had before, and it feels wonderful and right.”</span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Since that day, these feeling have stayed with her, and have helped her to grow in many ways. We’ve since discovered that releasing someone’s Heart-Wall is often followed by a profound experience of connection with other people. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Much of our personal and spiritual growth comes out of our love and interaction with others. The more open our hearts are, the stronger will be our connection to one another. The more connected we are, the more we can give and receive love, and the stronger and richer our lives will become. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I am so grateful for Jean and her dream that day. Without her, the Heart-Wall might still be completely unknown. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When we began to test other people for Heart-Walls, we found that they are a very common problem. Our experience is that eight out of ten people have one. Chances are, you do, too.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Joanne’s Bad Marriage </p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">One of the first people we tested for a Heart-Wall was a woman named Joanne. She had been married for twenty-two years and had five children. Her husband was mentally and verbally abusive. He had created such a toxic experience in their home that the rest of the family wondered why she chose to stay in such a bad marriage year after year. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Like most women in her position, Joanne had endured the marriage by creating a Heart-Wall that helped insulate her tender heart from her husband’s abusive verbal and emotional assaults. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I suspected that Joanne had a Heart-Wall, and her body responded “Yes” when I asked if she did. Next I wondered what her Heart-Wall might be made of. Were all Heart-Walls made of wood? I didn’t know, but when I asked that question, her body said “No.” </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Not wood. Well, how about some kind of metal? The answer was “Yes”, some kind of metal. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap"> “Is the metal iron?” I asked, trying to narrow it down. “No.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Is it steel?” I asked. “No.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I tried titanium, aluminum, copper and all the other kinds of metal I had ever heard of, but the answer was always “No.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">So I approached from a different angle. “Is this metal harder than iron?” “Yes.” </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Is this metal harder than steel?” Again, “Yes.” </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">As I continued this line of questioning, it gradually became apparent that the metal was harder than all the metals I could name. Feeling a bit exasperated, I asked, “Is your Heart-Wall made of metal that is harder than any metal that actually exists on earth? ”Her answer was definitive: “Yes.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Wait a minute. What? How could her Heart-Wall be made of a metal that was harder than any metal that existed on earth? </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Something Out of This World</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I was so caught up in my concrete questions that I’d forgotten one very important fact.</span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The Heart-Wall is a creation of the subconscious mind – where literally anything is possible. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">This wall is not physically made of any materials except the energy of a certain number of trapped emotions. It may not be “real” to us, but I believe that to the subconscious mind, although it is imaginary, it is also as real as anything else that exists in the world. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Its reality in the body is a very powerful one. That reality affects the systems of the body, just as our thoughts do. It has a direct influence on our health. But remember, the Heart-Wall is an imaginary construct – it can be made of literally anything at all.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Two years after Joanne was married, the abuse began. Her highest value was to keep her marriage together, so she stayed put. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Joanne had grown up in an idyllic and serene home, where she was cherished. According to Joanne, she could not remember her parents ever fighting, and the number of times that angry words were spoken could be counted on the fingers of one hand. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">As the abuse increased in her marriage, her subconscious mind searched desperately for protection. Trapped emotions were being formed, so the raw materials were there to build a wall, but what kind of material would her subconscious mind consider to be tough enough to protect her heart from Nick’s abuse? </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">It is said that the subconscious mind does not distinguish between what we perceive to be either “reality” or “non-reality.” For example, if you see a movie that is very frightening, your subconscious mind doesn’t “know” that you are not actually experiencing the celluloid-reality of the movie. Sure enough, your heart will pound, your palms will sweat, and your biochemical reactions will be just the same. Adrenalin will course through your veins, and all the reactions that occur in a fight or flight situation will be the same as if your viewed reality is, indeed, reality itself. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Essentially, the subconscious mind treats everything that comes into it from your conscious mind as reality, whether it is or not. Which brings us back to Joanne, who has a Heart-Wall made of metal, but a certain kind of metal, stronger than any metal that exists on earth. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">At some point, long ago, Joanne had seen an alien spaceship on a science fiction show. The Army fired missiles at it. When the smoke cleared, it was still there. They shot cannons at it – to no effect. They even launched a nuclear warhead at this alien spacecraft, but when the smoke cleared, it was still there. The scientists were stunned; the spacecraft was made of an entirely unknown substance, a metal that did not exist on earth, one that was apparently indestructible. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Yes!” Her subconscious mind said, “That’s exactly what I need!” And this alien, make believe metal from an old sci-fi movie became her Heart-Wall construction material. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">So Joanne had a Heart-Wall made of indestructible metal from an alien spacecraft. What better way to protect her heart? Remember, the Heart-Wall is from the deep imagination, from the subconscious mind of the person who unconsciously creates it. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Once we’d found out what it was made of at the metaphorical level, we began to release the trapped emotions that had been organized into this wall around Joanne’s heart. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Because she was still in this marriage with her abusive husband, we realized that her Heart-Wall had probably been a very important factor in her remaining married to Nick. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">It had protected her heart all these years. Was removing the Heart-Wall the right thing to do? Was it the right thing for Joanne, at this point in her life? Her body had created the Heart-Wall for a reason, but there is always a price that you pay when you have a Heart-Wall, that price mainly being a diminished ability to feel.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">We decided that the only safe route would be to ask her subconscious mind if it was okay to begin releasing these trapped emotions that were making up her Heart-Wall. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap"> “Can we release a trapped emotion from your Heart-Wall now?” I asked.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Her body said “Yes.” It was okay to begin getting rid of these trapped emotions that were making up her Heart-Wall. In fact, Joanne’s body wanted them gone! So we began to clear them out, finding them one at a time through muscle testing. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Each time we would release a trapped emotion, we would re-check the thickness of the Heart-Wall, which we had initially found to be seven feet thick.  </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Is the Heart-Wall still seven feet thick?” “No,” her body responded.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Is it six feet thick?” “Yes.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Again, with every trapped emotion we released, her Heart-Wall became thinner. The distance by which the Heart-Wall thickness diminished varied, depending on the emotion. Sometimes one released emotion would reduce the Heart-Wall by an entire foot. Other times, a released emotion would make less difference, resulting in a six-inch change or less. In Joanne’s case, there was no waiting period between releasing one emotion and the next; her subconscious mind was ready to release them all in a row, just as fast as we could find them and let them go. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Connecting the Dots</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">As we identified each trapped emotion, I also asked when that specific trapped emotion had become trapped. Asking that question helped Joanne connect the trapped emotions to specific events in her life that had caused her so much pain. We found that she did not have a Heart-Wall until the second year of her marriage, when things really started to become difficult. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">As we traced back the origins of the individual trapped emotions, it was easy to see why Joanne had needed a Heart-Wall that was indestructible. One of her trapped emotions was from the time her husband had held a gun to his head and threatened to kill himself in front of her. Another trapped emotion was from the time that he fell into a fit of rage over her religious practices and literally burned her Bible in front of her. There were nine different emotions that had become trapped in her body, each of them having to do with some extreme experience with her husband, Nick.</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Feeling Again With Her Heart</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">It took about thirty minutes to release all nine of these emotions and completely clear Joanne’s Heart-Wall. When her body indicated that the Heart-Wall was gone, Joanne smiled quietly. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“How are you feeling?” I asked her. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“A little dazed,” she said. “But good...” Then she went back home to Nick.</span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">For twenty-two years, Joanne had an impenetrable wall around her heart. Now that the wall was gone, suddenly, she was able to feel in her heart all the barbs, all the meanness and all the venom that Nick heaped on her, from the moment she walked in the door. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">For the first time in many years, she was really </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">feeling</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> what was going on in her relationship with Nick. Her Heart-Wall had been shielding her from the full force of his cruelty. Now that she could experience it for what it really was, without the protective wall, she couldn’t believe she’d stayed with him for so long. Who could tolerate this kind of abuse? And why should she put up with it anymore? Within two weeks she had left Nick for good, and filed for divorce. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Like so many of our body’s defenses, a Heart-Wall can be an invaluable safety measure in the short-term. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When something overwhelming happens, an emergency action can save your life. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">If you’re being bombed, it’s a good idea to hide in a bunker. But you wouldn’t want to live there. If you did, you’d miss out on the joys and wonders of life. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The same is true with a Heart-Wall. No matter how important it was to your life at the time it was created, you will be able to live a happier, more connected life as soon as you can tear it down. Sometimes, it can make the difference between living a life of disappointment and living happily ever after. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Miranda and the Old Boyfriend</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Miranda is a perfect example of how a Heart-Wall can interfere with your love life. She was an attractive 38-year-old nurse who came to me suffering from neck pain. During the course of the examination, she mentioned that she had not dated anyone in years and had no interest in having any kind of a relationship with men anymore. When I tested her, I was not surprised to find that she had a Heart-Wall.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Eight years before, Miranda’s heart had been broken in a relationship with a man she had deeply loved. In an effort to protect her heart from experiencing that kind of pain and injury again, her subconscious mind had created a Heart-Wall. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">In Miranda’s case, three lingering emotions had been trapped in her body for all those years, blocking her from experiencing a loving relationship. She had no idea that these trapped emotions were the major underlying cause of the pain she was experiencing in her neck as well. Her neck pain had been going on for some time, and was considered chronic and even a bit mysterious by the other doctors she had consulted, as nothing seemed to relieve it. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">One by one, we cleared each of these emotions. At the end, I asked her body if the Heart-Wall had finally been released. Her body said that it was completely gone.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I didn’t see Miranda again for about three months. When I did, she looked incredibly happy. I asked her what had changed and she excitedly said, “Everything!” She reported that her neck pain was long gone. But there was even better news than that. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Right after I saw you last,” she said, “I ran into my childhood sweetheart. I hadn’t seen him since elementary school. But it turned out, he’d been living right around the corner from me – less than a block away – for almost eight years. We started dating and something really sparked between us. We’re in love! I think he’s going to ask me to marry him.”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The woman who had come into my office complaining of neck pain and swearing off men was gone for good. She was like a completely new person.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Thank you so much for helping me,” Miranda said. “If you hadn’t released my Heart-Wall, I honestly don’t think this would have happened. I was too closed-off before.” </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When trapped emotions and Heart-Walls are released, people sometimes say it’s like they can finally feel again. They can give and receive love freely for the first time in a long time. In that state, very interesting and wonderful things can happen. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap">How We Are Meant to Live</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">This is how we’re meant to live. We’re meant to live vibrant, healthy lives, filled with love and joy. Of all the emotions, love is the most pure and has the highest vibration. Love, that most powerful and most popular of all the emotions, is both </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">generated</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> by the heart and </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">received</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> by the heart. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When you have a Heart-Wall, you are not able to give love as well as you might, because that love energy that is in your heart cannot get out as well. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">At the same time, love that is being radiated toward you by other people is blocked to some degree.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">As a result, you can go through your life somewhat insulated from others, because of the emotional traumas you’ve been through and the subconscious wall that literally exists around your heart. The traumas were genuine enough and there is no doubt that they caused more pain than your body thought it could stand to feel again – that’s why the Heart-Wall made perfect sense at the time. But until you take it down, you’ll be trapped behind it to some degree, less able to reach out and connect with people, even the people you love most. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">People’s lives and the lives of their children and their families have been completely transformed when their Heart-Walls have been removed. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">About thirty percent of the time, the effects of releasing a Heart-Wall are very apparent and immediately noticeable, but most of the time the results are subtle, and the changes in a person’s life appear gradually, in ways that they themselves might not immediately recognize. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Paula and Her Angry Son</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">One day a woman named Paula came to my office with her son, Rick, who was 17 at the time. She told me that Rick was having problems with anger. He was hanging around with the wrong crowd and his grades were abysmal. She was afraid the next step might be drug use, and was looking to me for help. She had heard of our work with trapped emotions and was wondering if some of her son’s anger might be due to them. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I tested this very silent and angry young man and   found that he had a Heart-Wall. When I tested his mother, I wasn’t too surprised to find that she had a Heart-Wall as well. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">It quickly became apparent that Rick wasn’t the only one suffering from anger. His mother was also filled with anger and resentment toward her ex-husband, Rick’s father. She had a rather grim expression, and her jaw seemed to be set in a determined, angry clench. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">It took 5 different sessions to clear Rick’s Heart-Wall, each session taking no more than 10 minutes or so. Sometimes he was able to release two emotions during a session, but most of the time, just one. His Heart-Wall trapped emotions all revolved around his birth father and how he had felt abandoned by him over the last few years. His parent’s divorce had been terribly difficult for him. He had trapped emotions of anger, frustration, resentment and feelings of inferiority, among other </span><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idIndexMarker007"></a></span><span class="Drop-Cap">negative emotions. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">As soon as we’d completed the process, Rick started to change. It was amusing to see that even his hairstyle changed. When I first met him, Rick had an orange Mohawk; in his case, an expression of his defiance. Without the need to express anger and resentment anymore, he went back to more ordinary hair. Not only that, but his grades improved by several levels. He had always been a smart boy, but he was blocking his emotions behind a Heart-Wall and the pressure had been building up for a long time. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Before we released his Heart-Wall, feelings of rage would well up inside of Rick when he thought of his father. After we cleared the Heart-Wall, Rick could think about his father – even spend time with him – and be completely okay. Now that his simmering anger was a thing of the past, Rick felt happier and more motivated. When he let go of the Heart-Wall, he got his life back.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I will never forget the last time I saw Rick, and how dramatically transformed he was. I remember him not being able to wipe the smile off his face as he told me about a recent fishing trip with his birth-father, and how much his relationship with him had changed. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Curiously enough, when we cleared his mother’s Heart-Wall, she didn’t seem to notice any change. About two months after we cleared her Heart-Wall, Paula came back to the office and complained to me, saying “What’s going on? Rick is like a completely new person. I hardly recognize him. But I don’t feel any different than I felt before!”</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I explained that, when a Heart-Wall is removed, it often takes time for changes to be felt and for things to realign in your life. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The body has to go through a healing process once a Heart-Wall is removed, and that can take some time. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">It was hard to tell whether she accepted that explanation or not. I think she was disappointed that her own life hadn’t changed as dramatically as Rick’s. I didn’t see either of them for a while and wondered on occasion how they were doing. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Then about a year later, I ran into Paula in a very upscale department store in Orange County. She recognized me and waited to see if I would recognize her. She looked familiar, but I had no idea who she was. As we talked, it dawned on me who she was, but she looked so completely different that I scarcely recognized her. Her face radiated happiness. Her whole demeanor had changed. Since we had last seen each other, she had not only gotten a wonderful job at this store, but had also found a wonderful man, and they were happily married. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">As we talked, I found that Rick was continuing to do very well both in school and in life. I reminded her about her Heart-Wall and our conversation of a year before. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">“I don’t know if having my Heart-Wall cleared had something to do with this or not,” she grinned, “but my life is so much better now than it was a year ago I can hardly believe it!” </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">As I walked away from that encounter, I remembered how deeply angry and unhappy she had been only a year before and I couldn’t help but wonder where she would be if we had not cleared her Heart-Wall.</span></p>

They are helpless and trusting, and far too often, they are the victims of predatory or abusive adults and sometimes even cruel children. In these cases, Heart-Walls are always found. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Sometimes life is challenging even in wonderful homes and under the best of circumstances. The following letter is from a delightful woman whose son was diagnosed as being clinically depressed. After developing a trapped emotion while witnessing the death of a close friend, a Heart-Wall was formed to keep his poor little heart from entirely breaking. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Nine Years Old, and Depressed</p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Dear Doctor Nelson,</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Several weeks ago I brought my nine-year-old son to see you. He had been exhibiting unusual behavior. He was having difficulty eating, sleeping, and concentrating. He had become angry, negative and pessimistic. School was a nightmare! We tried urging, punishing, rewarding and bribing him to complete his school assignments. When they were finally completed he would not turn them into the teacher. He is a very intelligent boy yet his grades suffered because his assignments were not turned in.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">I set up an appointment with his pediatrician to be evaluated. We were then referred to a pediatric neurologist, and then to a psychologist for further review </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-23">–</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> they concluded that my son was depressed. (Two years ago my son witnessed the drowning of a very close friend and ten months later was whisked away to the funeral of his cousin. Four other relatives were buried within the next six months and I believe these events had a distressing effect on my son. I tried to help him cope with these events, but apparently they were still affecting him.)</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">When I brought him to see you, he was tested and you determined that he had a “Heart-Wall” causing an emotional imbalance in his body. The </span><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idIndexMarker008"></a></span><span class="Drop-Cap">MagCreator was used to roll-out each of the </span><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idIndexMarker009"></a></span><span class="Drop-Cap">negative emotions associated with the Heart-Wall. I do not understand all the scientific aspects of this type of treatment yet I believed I had finally found the answer to the growing problems with my son. After you worked on him he was a little lethargic for a couple of days, but the changes I noticed in his behavior in the weeks that followed were absolutely incredible!</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">By the end of the first week he was sleeping and eating normally, and was once again happy and enthusiastic. He now completes every homework assignment without any nudging on my part. Our home is much more pleasant </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-23">–</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> he is helpful, kind and patient. I feel like my sweet little boy has returned!</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">If skepticism had kept me away from this type of treatment, I would still be parenting a very sad and frustrated little boy with no solution in sight. Instead, I have found a treatment that has literally saved him. Thank you Dr. Nelson for all your help. Your knowledge and expertise in this field and your patience and concern have had a tremendous impact… My heartfelt gratitude to you for all that you have done to heal my son.</span></p>

			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">One of the most touching experiences I had with children is told by a young mother named Meisha. Her three year old son, Jacob had developed a Heart-Wall shortly after his birth and the death of his twin brother. I treated him and released his Heart-Wall in one visit, and later she wrote this testimonial for you to read.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Three and a half years ago I gave birth to twin sons. Nine days following birth they contracted a virus, which ultimately attacked their hearts, leaving them in critical condition for two months. Jordan, the eldest twin, passed away due to multiple complications leaving Jacob, who then quickly recovered enough to come home but with continual problems with his heart. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Not only was Jacob left with heart failure, but with a Heart-Wall made from deep, lasting emotions that were manifested in excessive anger, destructiveness, unhappiness, insecurity and aggression. A day or two following treatment my tender hearted son was back. Friends would comment on how happy he appeared.  He was helpful and kind, patient and pleasant. His behavior was polar opposite from when his heavy emotions were weighing him down. I know through continued treatments my dear son will be emotionally healed and allowed to live the happy life that he is entitled to. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">- Meisha E., Texas</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">As news of our discovery of the Heart-Wall spread, other practitioners began to come to us for training, although the majority of attendees continued to be lay-people. The following Heart-Wall story was submitted by Gwen Legler, a counselor in Washington State. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">The Hated Heart-Wall</p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">I have found that people usually choose a Heart-Wall substance that has a positive memory or image for them. That is why I was so surprised with Pearl’s negative reaction to her Heart-Wall made of Rhododendron bushes. She hated rhododendrons and couldn’t believe her subconscious chose them. I double-checked, and it was correct. I found it interesting that her body would not let me identify her Heart-Wall until the third visit, and then it would only let me remove a few emotions. It was definitely protecting her from something. I suggested we continue and maybe we would understand why.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">By the fifth visit we began to remove more emotions </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-23">–</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> guilt, heartache, hatred, betrayal, grief, and so on. It soon became apparent that her Heart-Wall was like a storage unit for one particular incident in her life. About 16 years ago she had an extramarital affair for which she felt extreme guilt and self-loathing. Although she stopped and never had another affair and was forgiven by her husband, she couldn’t seem to forgive herself and put it behind her. Now we realized her Heart-Wall was a bush she hated because it contained an experience she hated. We cleared the Heart-Wall and she found peace and was able to forgive herself. </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">The Ring Dream</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Pat and her husband Jim attended the first seminar that I taught, which was held in San Diego in 1996. I received this letter from them about their experience with a recurring nightmare that was being caused by a Heart-Wall. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">I wanted to share my experiences with Heart-Walls with you. Jimmy and I attended a seminar in San Diego with you, where you explained Heart-Walls, how to find them, and break through them. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">My daughter died in 1987, and after a while I began having a recurring nightmare that we called “The Ring Dream.” Nancy had loved rings, so I always connected the dream with her. I would wake up hysterical and screaming, clutching my hands looking for my rings. I could never remember what caused the panic, or why it was so important to find my rings. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">After we attended your seminar, we decided to check me for a Heart-Wall. Needless to say, we found one! We worked back through the years, clearing the layers of trapped emotions as we went. At two years of age, I had a trapped emotion of abandonment. As I had always been with my family, I did not quite believe what the testing was showing. I told my mother about the Heart-Wall, and the abandonment emotion. She told me that when I was two, she had left me with my grandmother and had gone to stay with my father at an Army camp. My grandmother had said for her to go, that she would take care of me, that I was just a baby and wouldn’t miss my mother. It was a story that I had never heard before, but it had left its impression on me when I was 2 years old. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Jimmy and I worked together and cleared all the trapped emotions that were making up my Heart-Wall. What a relief it was to us to discover that the dream stopped, and did not return. While we both felt we learned a lot at your seminar, nothing compared to the joy we felt we received when that horrible dream stopped. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">I appreciate the opportunity to share this with you. We have shared this story with other people we have met, but I’m glad to finally be able to tell you about it. Thank you so much for this wonderful program. </span></p>

			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"></a>Finding and Releasing the Heart-Wall</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Now let’s talk about how you can actually determine if a person has a Heart-Wall, and how you can release it. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">To find a Heart-Wall, you simply ask. Unless you actually </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-16">ask</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> the person’s subconscious mind if they have a Heart-Wall, it will not be revealed. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The Heart-Wall is made of trapped emotions, but the subconscious mind no longer categorizes them as such. These emotions are now part of a wall and are inaccessible until you ask if there is a Heart-Wall. You have to get the mindbody to admit that there is a wall, before you can get to the trapped emotions that are creating it. Once you do that, the trapped emotions once again become recognizable to the subconscious mind as trapped emotions, and  therefore, are vulnerable to being released. As you release them, one by one, the wall will come down.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">It’s really simple. Ask, “Do you have a Heart-Wall?” Then use the muscle test of your choice to get the body’s response.</span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">My experience is that about 80% of the general public will test positive for a Heart-Wall. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"></a>Use of the Word “Hidden”</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">When you ask, “Do you have a Heart-Wall?” and the answer is no, there might be another phenomenon at work. Quite often, the Heart-Wall will actually be hidden and will not show up unless you actually use the word “hidden” in your question or statement. The whole purpose of the Heart-Wall is to protect one’s heart, or in other words, to </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">hide</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> the heart from those who might do it emotional harm. It seems that sometimes the Heart-Wall gets a bit </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">too</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> hidden to readily detect, but if you expressly use the word “hidden” when you ask, it will show up.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">To check for this possibility, simply add the word “hidden” to your question or statement. For example, you could ask, “Do you have a </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">Hidden</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> Heart-Wall?” If they have one, and it’s hidden, it will be revealed. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">It’s important to remember this tip. I can’t tell you how often I’ve had to use the word “hidden” to find Heart-Walls that would otherwise not have been detectable. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">A </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-16">hidden</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> Heart-Wall is not a different kind of  Heart-Wall. It’s simply a Heart-Wall that is a bit more difficult to find. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Once the body has opened up to you, to let you know that a hidden Heart-Wall is there, you can proceed without having to use the word hidden anymore, because it’s no longer hidden. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Is it Ready to Be Released?</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Once you have determined that a Heart-Wall is present, ask “Can we release an emotion from the Heart-Wall now?” The Heart-Wall is there for a reason, and while ultimately the effects of having a Heart-Wall are negative to the health and well-being of the individual, some people are in situations where they simply are not ready or willing to give up the protection of the Heart-Wall for now, and you need to respect that. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">If a Heart-Wall is present, but you get a negative response about removing it, your subject may want to meditate on why the subconscious mind is giving that answer. Is it unsafe, or are they already processing some other things that are taxing the mindbody? At any rate, it is important to listen to their subconscious. It knows what is best for them.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">If you get a yes answer to your question, you then simply follow the same process outlined in chapter six and follow it. For your convenience, there is a flowchart on page 278 that is specifically for releasing Heart-Walls. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The Emotion Code works the same way to release trapped emotions whether they are part of a Heart-Wall or not. When you ask, “Can we release an emotion from the Heart-Wall now?” and you get a positive answer, the mindbody has a particular emotion in mind that it is willing to release. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">You don’t get to choose which emotion will be released first; the subconscious mind of the subject will do that. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">As soon as you receive a yes answer to this question, the trapped emotion has already been chosen. All you need to do now is determine which emotion it is on the chart, in order to bring it to conscious awareness. Identify it, determine any other information that the subconscious wants the conscious mind to know about it, and then release it. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Time to Process May be Needed</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">As I’ve explained previously, sometimes you will be able to release all the trapped emotions that are making up a Heart-Wall one after another, in one concentrated effort. At other times, the body will allow you to release a limited number of trapped emotions before needing to take time out to process what has been released, requiring from a few hours to a day or more before you can release another one. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">After verifying the release of a trapped emotion from the Heart-Wall, you simply return to your original question and ask, “Can we release an emotion from the Heart-Wall now?” If the answer is yes, and if you have the time, keep going. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">If the answer is no, you may want to check to see if perhaps the Heart-Wall is gone, by asking again, if they have a Heart-Wall. If they still have one, ask when you can release the next emotion – later today, in an hour, tomorrow, etc. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"></a>Determining the Heart-Wall Material</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Remember that the subconscious mind is very logical. Since it is patently illogical to have a “wall” made of nothing, the subconscious mind will always choose a material for the Heart-Wall to be made of. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">You don’t really </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">need</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> to know what substance the subconscious mind chose to build the Heart-Wall out of in order to release it. Ultimately, all Heart-Walls are made of the energy of trapped emotions, and releasing these trapped emotions is what really matters. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">On the other hand, determining the material that has been chosen is interesting because of the symbolism that is often revealed. There is no right or wrong way to ask what material has been used, but I usually start by asking if the material is wood. If it isn’t wood, I ask if it is a material harder or softer than wood. If it is harder than wood, I may ask if it is made from metal, etc. You can narrow it down pretty quickly using the process of deduction, and you’ll get some great practice using muscle testing.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">If you have determined what material the Heart-Wall is made of, you might then want to ask how thick the Heart-Wall is. They can range in thickness from paper-thin to </span><span class="Drop-Cap CharOverride-17">many</span><span class="Drop-Cap"> miles! All I can tell you is that this is what we have found in testing. Our subconscious minds are not limited like our conscious minds are, and can have quite an imagination! Yet I believe that the subconscious mind takes it all quite seriously, and really does believe that there is a wall there, made of whatever material has been chosen. </span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Sub">Heart-Wall Metaphors</p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">An older couple came to see me. The husband was very grouchy, and was dismissive and gruff with his wife. She seemed to be a very gentle soul. They both had Heart-Walls. His was made of solid steel, cold and hard, miles thick. Hers was many thousands of layers of curtain material, providing a nice cushion against his toxic personality. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">A gay man had a Heart-Wall made of solid diamond, which is the hardest known naturally occurring material. Incidentally, his subconscious would not allow me to release this wall.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I’ve seen Heart-Walls made of flowers, quilts, blankets, earth, stones, vegetation, leather, glass, all kinds of metals such as steel, titanium, and iron, as well as various construction materials such as logs, concrete blocks, bricks, and so on. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Quite often there will be a noticeable relevance between the personality of an individual and their Heart-Wall material. I treated a young child once who had a Heart-Wall made of yellow plastic, just like her little yellow plastic toys. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Sometimes Heart-Walls will have a door or a <br />window. Often the door will be locked, and nobody has the key but the owner. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">While often a Heart-Wall is spherical, they can be box shaped, or any other shape you can imagine. Sometimes they have sharp edges or projections on their surface to keep people out. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">One young man couldn’t seem to form close attachments with women, although he was very handsome, had everything else going for him, and had many opportunities. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I found that his Heart-Wall was made of a one-way mirror, which allowed him to see out, but no one else to see in. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I once treated a child whose most common expression was “I can’t!” I found and released his Heart-Wall. It was made from a single piece of paper. On it were the words, “I can’t!” His parents commented that after his Heart-Wall was released, he no longer felt that he couldn’t do things, and was happier and more positive. He also stopped whining and saying “I can’t!”</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap">Anne Horne’s Story</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">A woman named Anne Horne wrote from Seattle to tell me of a remarkable near-death experience she had, in which she saw people in the future, helping others remove their Heart-Walls. Here, in her own words, is her story, or see the video at this link:</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><a href="http://www.healerslibrary.com/news/anne-hornes-near-death-experience/"><span class="Drop-Cap"><span class="Hyperlink">healerslibrary.com/news/anne-hornes-near-death-experience/</span></span></a></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Dear Dr. Nelson-</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">I originally came into contact with your work when a practitioner here in Seattle named Marguerite used your techniques to balance my body. At the end of the session, Marguerite turned around and just as an afterthought said, “Oh, let’s see if you have a Heart-Wall...” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">“What is a Heart-Wall?” I said. “I don’t understand.” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">And she said, “That’s okay. You don’t have to know what it is. I’ll just test you for it.” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">So she did, and I didn’t have one. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Then she said, “Let’s test you for a hidden Heart-Wall.” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">“All right,” I said. “But what is it?” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">“That’s okay,” she said, smiling. “You don’t have to understand.” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">She checked me for a hidden Heart-Wall, but I didn’t have one of those either. Then she explained how emotions can put up a wall between yourself and others around your heart. When she found a Heart-Wall, she would run a magnet down a person’s back to release those emotions and open their hearts.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. It was like an electric bolt went through me. Suddenly, an event that had happened to me twenty-five years ago made sense. It was the realization of a very significant event that I’d experienced when I was 23 years old.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">When I was 23, I died. It was a violent death. I had one of those near-death experiences that 10 million other people have also experienced. But when I was 23, nobody talked about this stuff. I’d never heard of seeing a tunnel or white light or anything like that. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">It was a very important experience for me. I left my body and had a life review. I was a young thing and hadn’t done anything particularly exciting or big. But I was going back, home, and on my way, there was a light, a tunnel. I felt like I was being pulled by my heart toward a wonderful place. In that moment, I was encompassed by all this innate intelligence and tremendous love. And I just wanted to go home. It was fantastic. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">I found myself facing this man who was standing in front of me – we were not on the ground, we were just floating – and he said, “It’s not your time.” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">I said, “But I want to go home.” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">He turned away from me and I could see him conferring with someone else, but I didn’t know what they were saying. Then he turned around and said, “I’m sorry. It’s not your time.” But apparently, he did get permission to show me something about my life. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">And suddenly, I realized where we were, because we looked down, and there was the earth. We were way out somewhere in space. And I could see the earth below us. We were looking at the Americas, specifically the West Coast of North America. We were looking at the Northwest area, Colorado, Texas, and down through California. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Now, I’m from Virginia and I died in North Carolina. At 23 years old, I had never even left the state. I was very young. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">I could see many people in groups, sometimes large groups of 20 or 30, and sometimes just a few people together. They were in groups doing a specific training that was very unusual. There would be two or three people together, with one person lying on a table, or standing up, and another person who was rolling something down the other person’s back. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">I knew this was in my future, that I was one of these people. I could feel the sense of urgency that they were feeling. It was like a numbers game; we had to treat as many people as possible. We were really in a rush, really hurrying. It was very, very, very vital. I couldn’t quite understand what was going on, but I noticed we were dressed in white. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">“Are we nurses?” I asked him. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">And he said “No, you’re not nurses.” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">I said, “Well, what are we doing?” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">“You’re opening people’s hearts,” he said. “Not in a physical way. You’re removing all blocks from their hearts so that they can give love and receive love from here.”</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">At that moment, the people doing this work became consciously aware of each another. It wasn’t something planned, it wasn’t some kind of harmonic convergence, or anything else. It just happened. We became conscious of each other. And at that moment, the meaning of this work became clear to me. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Suddenly a flood of energy was sent to the earth from where I was, above the earth. It looked like a white bolt of energy that came in through our open hearts in the back and went out through the front of our hearts into the world. We were there opening people’s hearts so that they could be anchors for this divine energy to come into this world. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Within three seconds, the world was completely transformed by this energy. This light went into every crack and crevice, everywhere, and there was no darkness in this world, ever again.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">The next thing that happened was, the doctors resuscitated me and I was brought back to life. But it was OK because, once I got back, I pretty much thought that I had a mission from God. And I thought “Oh, my life is going to be so great!” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">Well, my life has been a living hell! I have tried to have all kinds of trainings, looking for something that matched my experience on the other side, thinking, “Well, where is it? If this is my mission, when am I going to find out how to get started?” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">I worked for the Edgar Cayce Foundation for Research and Enlightenment. I studied Quantum Physics for 25 years. I took courses in Physics of the Mind. I became certified as a Neurolinguistic Programming trainer and in hypnosis. I’m a graduate of the HeartMath Institute. I’m a trained counselor in chemical dependency, timeline therapy, and core transformation therapy. All the while, I’ve been doing my best to help improve people’s lives, but searching for the connection between the work I was doing and what I’d seen.</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">I don’t know if you’ve heard of the theory of the 100 monkeys. It’s about reaching critical mass. There was an island of monkeys. Scientists came in and taught one monkey to wash his sweet potatoes. After 100 of them learned how to do it, all the monkeys on the island knew how to do it. Scientists thought that was pretty amazing. But that was only part of it. They soon realized that as soon as these 100 monkeys knew how to do it, the other monkeys automatically knew how to do it too. But not just the monkeys on that island. The monkeys on the islands all around that island began to wash their sweet potatoes, too!</span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">It is like Dr. Nelson says, quantum physics has shown us that information travels instantly. If people’s hearts are opened, we can reach critical mass. </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">During my near-death experience, I said to the man who met me, “But there are only thousands of us.” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">And he replied, “Millions will hear, but only thousands will remember.” </span></p>
			<p class="Quotation"><span class="Drop-Cap">And we only need thousands. Thank you for giving me a way to fulfill my mission. - Anne Horne</span></p>
			<p class="Paragraph-Header"><span class="Drop-Cap">Counting the Cost</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The price we pay for having Heart-Walls is incalculable. How many people have led disconnected and lonely lives due to the walls around their hearts? How many people have not experienced the joy of finding love in their lives? How many wives and children have been abused?</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Heart-Walls can lead to depression, divorce, and abuse. The patterns of abuse that are created can pass from generation to generation, causing all manner of pain and destructive behavior. </span></p>
			<p class="Popout-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">The result of Heart-Walls on a larger scale leads to misunderstanding, prejudice, hatred and brutality. On a global scale, Heart-Walls lead to ethnic cleansing, nation against nation, terrorism, and war.</span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">There is altogether too much of isolation and violence, too much of sorrow and pain in this world. When I walk down the street, I see so many people with tight, clenched jaws like Paula had or boys with angry, resentful expressions, acting out their pain and frustration any way they can. The news is filled every night with one story after another about people whose hearts must be barricaded behind strong walls for them to do the things they do. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">Widespread depression is another common side effect of Heart-Walls and trapped emotions. In the United States alone, it is estimated that between 13 and 14 million people suffer from depression. It is the leading cause of disability in American women. Nearly 15 percent of those women will ultimately commit suicide. Among children and young adults – between 10 and 24 years old – suicide is the third leading cause of death. By releasing trapped emotions and removing Heart-Walls, we have seen cases of severe depression eliminated once and for all. We have seen marriages saved, abuse stopped, and lives turned around. We’ve seen beautiful, loving relationships begin. We’ve seen kids make better choices. We’ve seen peace restored. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">I am so grateful to be able to share what I have learned about trapped emotions and Heart-Walls, and to be able to bring this information to light. There is no doubt in my mind that it comes from above, and is meant to bless many lives in these times that are so trying in so many ways. I feel so blessed to have been led to discover a method that has such a powerfully transformative effect on people’s lives. It’s an exciting thing to be a part of. </span></p>
			<p class="Manuscript-Text"><span class="Drop-Cap">If you have a Heart-Wall, can you see how important it is for you to clear that wall away? Can you see the importance of helping your own children and your own family? Can you see how transformational it would be if we could do the same thing for the whole world? Imagine how this world will change when we can open enough people’s hearts to create a critical mass. As in Anne’s near-death experience, that critical mass, perhaps only thousands of us, will be enough to help transform this planet forever. Those whose hearts are open will be the anchors for that divine energy that will transform and heal the world. </span></p>
