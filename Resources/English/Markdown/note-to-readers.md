## A Note to Readers

*The Emotion Code is a self-help method that quite often produces marvelous results and wonderful benefits, both physical and emotional in nature. Nevertheless, it is a relatively new discovery and has not been thoroughly studied.*
*This book is based on the personal observations and experiences of Dr. Bradley Nelson. You, the reader, must take 100% responsibility for your own health, both physical and emotional. The Emotion Code should not be misconstrued or used to diagnose the presence or absence of any particular mental, physical or emotional ailment. Neither muscle testing nor the Sway Test should be used to diagnose the presence or absence of disease.*
