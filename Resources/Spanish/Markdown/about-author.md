### Healing Tools

I have found that trapped emotions can be released by using magnets of all types and strengths, as well as zero-point energy devices. Simply sliding your fingertips over the governing meridian will release a trapped emotion, since the body has it’s own energy field. Nevertheless, there are healing tools available that not only work well with The Emotion Code, but are very beneficial in other ways as well, and as long you are using The Emotion Code to help people, you may want to consider the following tools:

### Nikken Magnets

Personally, I prefer to use the magnets manufactured by the Japanese company, Nikken, Inc., because they are specifically designed for use on the body, and are very comfortable to use. The magnets that I use to release trapped emotions are designed to roll down the back, are easy to hold, and as they spin, they produce a larger magnetic field.

I still use them whenever I can. I have found numerous applications for them (for example, to reduce discomfort, where a refrigerator magnet would not have the same effect). I believe that the Nikken magnets are well worth the modest investment required.

Many years of clinical research in Japan has gone into the design and creation of Nikken’s magnets, and they work very well. In fact, all the stories in this book that involve the use of magnets to release trapped emotions are referring to Nikken magnets.

The two specific magnets that I recommend for practicing The Emotion Code are both made by Nikken. They are the MagBoy, a small, hand-held magnet that can easily roll over the governing meridian, and the MagCreator, a larger, beautifully designed massage tool made with heavy-duty roller bearings, built to last. Either one of these is ideal.

### Zero Point Energy Devices

Another very exciting new technology that is now available is called “zero-point” energy. Zero-point energy is the energy that surrounds and is between all the atoms and subatomic particles of the universe. Indeed, zero-point energy fills the immensity of space. Your body, like everything else that exists, is filled with this particular kind of energy.

It seems that certain crystals, when pressurized and treated in a particular way, resonate very powerfully with the frequency of zero-point energy.

I have used zero-point devices with great success. Not only are the zero-point wands easy to use and very effective for releasing trapped emotions, they often have an astonishing ability to reduce discomfort and restore balance and function to imbalanced tissues.

I have witnessed enough success A Zero-Point Wand    stories to know for myself that this is a very exciting technology that releases trapped emotions fully as well as any magnet, and often works to release discomfort and improve healing in many cases.

### The Body Code

The Emotion Code is part of a larger body of work that I call the Body Code System. During my years in practice I developed a very simple, yet comprehensive method of addressing any and all imbalances that a person might have. This system worked extremely well for me, even with the most difficult cases. Using The Body Code, it is possible to tap into the subconscious mind to find and fix nearly any kind of imbalance, whatever it might be. I had always had a vague plan to teach this system to doctors at some undefined future day. A few years ago, however, I awoke one morning with the very clear instruction that I must take everything I had learned about healing and create a self-study course, so that this knowledge could be had by everyone, everywhere.

The Body Code System - A Comprehensive Self-Study Course

It took a year for me to create the Body Code System, but it is now available. I believe it is without doubt the most comprehensive self-study course on energy healing that has ever been devised, and consists of 18 DVDs, 2 manuals, an interactive mind-map for your computer, and more.
