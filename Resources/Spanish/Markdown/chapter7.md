*I don’t wanna look like some kind of fool-I don’t wanna break my heart over you.*
*I’m building a wall. Everyday it’s getting higher. This time I won’t end up another Victim of love.*
*I’m gonna lock up what I’m feeling inside. Ain’t no way you can break down the door.*

*-“Victim of Love” lyrics by the group Erasure*

## The Walls Around Our Hearts

Trapped emotions can create a wall around your heart that can block you from living life to the fullest. I received this letter from a wonderful woman, a former patient of mine who had a Heart-Wall, once upon a time…

###  The Heart-Brain

Your heart generates 60 to 1000 times more power and electromagnetic energy than your brain, easily making it the most powerful organ in your body. When you were in the womb, your heart was formed first, before your brain. Your heart beats about 100,000 times a day, 40 million times a year, and if its connection to your brain were severed, it would keep right on beating.


----------


**Your heart is the core of your being, the core of who you really are.**


----------


New research shows that your heart is much more than a mere pump. In the 1970s, scientists learned that the heart has an elaborate nervous system, a discovery that has led to the creation of a new branch of medicine known as neurocardiology. The fact is, we all have two brains. Much to these scientists’ surprise, they discovered that the brains in our heads are obeying messages sent by “the brains in our hearts.”

Your heart is constantly sending out information to your body. Every beat carries critical messages that affect your emotional and physical health.


----------


**When you feel love toward someone, you are actually sending out a powerful electromagnetic signal to them, using the heart brain.**


----------


Medical research experiments have repeatedly shown that there are measurable positive effects on the body when we feel love and appreciation toward someone else. The same beneficial affect occurs in your own body when you are on the receiving end – when love and appreciation are being broadcast toward you.[^1]

Scientists have discovered that the electromagnetic signals radiating from your heart are actually detectable in the brain waves of another person. This phenomenon is strongest when two people are touching or are in close proximity but is measurable at a distance as well.[^2]

For several decades, medical science has had the remarkable ability to transplant organs from one person’s body to another. But remember the story of the World War II veteran and his blood cells. If a person’s individual cells keep their connection so strongly no matter where they are, think what a connection an entire organ must retain! We’ve all heard stories about transplant recipients who suddenly take an interest in a certain sport, or who have an unexplained craving for their donor’s favorite food. Heart transplant patients have reported these symptoms from the beginning, but doctors have had no way to understand it, so they attributed it to the patients’ imaginations.


Try telling that to the transplant patient who has never liked hot dogs or baseball, but who now can’t get enough of them since he received the heart of an avid White Sox fan. Or the woman who can’t keep from crying every time she hears a certain song, a song which meant nothing to her before her transplant.


----------


**The heart has its own unique intelligence. It can think, feel and remember.**


----------


There is now considerable evidence that the heart contains memories and feelings. A large number of heart transplant recipients have reported new food and drink preferences and cravings, as well as handwriting changes, musical preferences, and memories that don’t seem to be their own.[^3]


### The Discovery of the Heart-Wall

Have you ever felt that you needed to “put up a wall” to protect yourself in a negative situation? It appears that this common phrase has a basis in reality. We call this phenomenon the “Heart-Wall”, and here is how we were led to discover it.

In March of 1998, my wife Jean and I were in Portland, Oregon, attending a conference on magnetic healing where I was one of the guest speakers.

Early one morning, she woke me to say she’d had a powerful dream. She felt strongly that her dream had a deep meaning, and that it had something to do with her own health.

In her dream, Jean saw a stainless steel order wheel like those found in restaurants and diners. She explained that the wheel had three orders clipped to it. She understood intuitively that each order represented a different issue having to do with her health.

Her subconscious mind knew the meaning of this dream, so I began muscle testing her, asking questions about the orders attached to the wheel. We quickly determined the meaning of the first two health issues. When I turned my attention to the third order on the wheel, something completely unexpected happened.

Suddenly I had a waking vision.

I could see very clearly in my mind’s eye a beautiful, highly polished hardwood floor. Along with this vision came the understanding that Jean’s heart was under this floor!

This made no logical sense, but the image of this gleaming floor, and the perception that her heart was under it, were very persistent and clear. I determined to figure out what it all meant, if I could. I told Jean what I was seeing, and asked her if she had any insight into what this meant.


“Well, last night I wasn’t feeling all that well, and Lana told me that she sensed there was some kind of energy over my heart. I wonder if that is what she was picking up.” My sister-in-law Lana is a Reiki Master, and a very gifted and intuitive healer. “I really don’t know what it means.”


Fascinated, we began muscle testing to find out more about this hardwood flood.

“First, let’s find out how thick this floor is,” I said. “Is it one plank thick?”

Her arm was strong. The answer was “Yes.”

“Is it two planks thick?” “Yes.”

“It is three planks thick?” “Yes.”

Patiently, we went up by the numbers – five planks, ten planks, twenty, fifty, 100, 200 … Before long, I began asking about the thickness in feet.

“Is this floor 100 feet thick?” “Yes.”

“Is it 500 feet thick?” “Yes.”

And on it went – 1000 feet, 2000 feet, 3000 feet, 4000 … “Is it 5000 feet thick?” “Yes.”

“Is this floor a mile thick?” “Yes.”

“Is it two miles, three miles, four miles thick?” “Yes, yes, yes.”

“Is this floor five miles thick?” “Yes.”

“Is this floor six miles thick?” “No.”

This was quite strange, and we couldn’t imagine what it meant. I was certain that it had some significant meaning, so I continued testing. It quickly became apparent that the hardwood floor I could see so clearly in my mind was exactly five miles thick. I had never had a waking vision like this before, yet the answers we were getting were very clear.


Three things were certain. I could see the floor vividly in my mind. I knew that in some symbolic way my wife’s heart was underneath this floor. The floor was very thick, five miles thick to be exact. What in the world could this possibly mean?


I asked, “Is there a wall around your heart?” “Yes.”

“Is this wall five miles thick?” “Yes.”

“Is it made of wood?” “Yes.”

What exactly was this that we were in the process of discovering? Was it something of consequence?

Quieting my mind for a moment led me to ask another question. “Is this wall made up of trapped emotions?”

Her arm was strong. The answer was “Yes.”


----------


**Suddenly the symbolic meaning became clear to me. I knew how vulnerable the human heart is to being hurt. I also knew Jean’s past.**


----------


Jean had been a sensitive and shy little girl. She had grown up in an imperfect, dysfunctional household like many of us do. While she has some wonderful memories, and while she loved her parents and siblings and knew they loved her, she didn’t feel safe emotionally.


She could never predict what the emotional tone in her home might be from one moment to the next. Anger and harsh words frequently and suddenly erupted over things that should have been inconsequential. She and other family members would find themselves “walking on eggshells” at times like these. She never knew when she or someone else in the family might be lashed out at or blamed for something.


### Protecting the Core of You

People deal with uncomfortable situations such as these in many ways. Some attack, some retreat, and some hide. But usually, we feel the need to defend and shield ourselves from being hurt.

Your heart is the core of your being. Your subconscious mind knows that it must protect your heart; it must protect your delicate core in any way it can.

Words like “heartache” and “heartbreak” are so-called because of the peculiar physical sensation that occurs in the heart under strong emotional strain. Nearly everyone has felt this sensation at one point or another.


Trapped emotions have substance. They consist of energy, just like everything else. When trapped emotions are created, they must reside somewhere in your body, and sometimes they will lodge in and around your heart.


----------


**Your subconscious mind – which knows no limitations – will sometimes use the energy of these trapped emotions to create a barrier or shield around your heart. Literally, it creates a wall of energy around your heart, to protect it.**


----------


At first, I puzzled over this process until I realized that the subconscious mind most likely follows certain rules. For example, it is not possible to create a wall out of nothing. In the world in which we live, all things around us are made of energy, and I believe the subconscious mind understands this concept implicitly. All walls that exist in the physical world around us, regardless of the chosen building material, are ultimately made of energy. The Heart-Wall, created by the subconscious mind, is also made of energy. It just happens to be made of a specific sort of energy, the energy of trapped emotions.

I believe that to the subconscious mind, the Heart-Wall is as real as the chair you are sitting in. The Heart-Wall exists, it’s just on a slightly different plane of reality than the world we can see with our physical eyes. Does that make the Heart-Wall any less real? I don’t think so. Remember that we cannot see ultraviolet light or indeed, the vast majority of the electromagnetic spectrum, yet no one disputes its reality.


When I asked Jean’s body if we could release the trapped emotions that were making up this wall around her heart, the answer was “Yes.”

Gradually, her body was willing to release these emotions. We found that the procedure for releasing emotions from the Heart-Wall was the same as for releasing any other trapped emotion. The only difference was that we had to ask specifically if we could release an emotion “from her Heart-Wall” in order to gain access to those emotions.


Each time we released a trapped emotion from Jean’s Heart-Wall, I would ask if we could release another emotion. Sometimes her body would allow us to clear more than one emotion in a single session, but often the answer was “No.”


It wasn’t surprising that her body needed a certain amount of time to process each of her emotions as they were released, so we patiently waited between sessions. We found that we were able to release a different trapped emotion roughly every other day until they were all gone, and Jean no longer had a Heart-Wall.


#### The Creation of Her Heart-Wall

Jean had learned to protect her feelings from childhood. She retreated to safety inside of herself, shutting down her positive feelings, and avoiding connection with those that she felt vulnerable toward. When there were volatile episodes in her home, she chose to feel fear, resentment and other negative emotions, some of which she expressed, but many that she internalized. Some of these feelings were never fully processed, and they became trapped energies in her body.


----------


**While she was consciously doing her best to deal with life, at the same time her subconscious was building a wall, an ultimate protection against her heart being injured again.**


----------


Her subconscious mind chose an imaginary wooden floor for her wall, specifically the hardwood that is walked upon. Do you see the symbolism there? The room she grew up in had a hardwood floor, as did much of her house back then, so it was a familiar sight. Her subconscious mind created her Heart-Wall at an early age, but it wasn’t completed for many years.

Each new trapped emotion gave her wall additional thickness and strength, until it was many thousands of feet thick.

As we released the emotions from her Heart-Wall, we found that the thickness of the wall decreased. We could never predict how much of a decrease in thickness might result with the release of a trapped emotion. Some trapped emotions would result in a large decrease in thickness, some in a little.


When the last trapped emotion was released, something very interesting happened that helped Jean move beyond her past and the way that she perceived herself.


#### Getting Reconnected Again

While Jean’s Heart-Wall protected her heart from damage and hurt, this protection came at a cost.

Having a Heart-Wall left her feeling numb and somewhat isolated. She felt disconnected from others. She wanted to have close friends, and she tried many times, but something was always in the way. She was well-liked, but she found it hard to be at ease with people. She had many associations, but few close friends. In social gatherings, even with people she had known for many years, she invariably felt that she was on the outside looking in, and she was never able to feel like she truly belonged.

When the last trapped emotion was finally released, and her Heart-Wall was gone, there was a profound shift.

“For the first time in my life, I’m not on the outside anymore,” she told me. “I’ve longed to feel this way my whole life. Now I know what it feels like to be part of a circle of friends, part of a group. It’s a very different feeling than I’ve ever had before, and it feels wonderful and right.”


----------


**Since that day, these feeling have stayed with her, and have helped her to grow in many ways. We’ve since discovered that releasing someone’s Heart-Wall is often followed by a profound experience of connection with other people.**


----------


Much of our personal and spiritual growth comes out of our love and interaction with others. The more open our hearts are, the stronger will be our connection to one another. The more connected we are, the more we can give and receive love, and the stronger and richer our lives will become.


I am so grateful for Jean and her dream that day. Without her, the Heart-Wall might still be completely unknown.

When we began to test other people for Heart-Walls, we found that they are a very common problem. Our experience is that eight out of ten people have one. Chances are, you do, too.

#### Joanne’s Bad Marriage

One of the first people we tested for a Heart-Wall was a woman named Joanne. She had been married for twenty-two years and had five children. Her husband was mentally and verbally abusive. He had created such a toxic experience in their home that the rest of the family wondered why she chose to stay in such a bad marriage year after year.


Like most women in her position, Joanne had endured the marriage by creating a Heart-Wall that helped insulate her tender heart from her husband’s abusive verbal and emotional assaults.

I suspected that Joanne had a Heart-Wall, and her body responded “Yes” when I asked if she did. Next I wondered what her Heart-Wall might be made of. Were all Heart-Walls made of wood? I didn’t know, but when I asked that question, her body said “No.”

Not wood. Well, how about some kind of metal? The answer was “Yes”, some kind of metal.

“Is the metal iron?” I asked, trying to narrow it down. “No.”


“Is it steel?” I asked. “No.”

I tried titanium, aluminum, copper and all the other kinds of metal I had ever heard of, but the answer was always “No.”

So I approached from a different angle. “Is this metal harder than iron?” “Yes.”

“Is this metal harder than steel?” Again, “Yes.”

As I continued this line of questioning, it gradually became apparent that the metal was harder than all the metals I could name. Feeling a bit exasperated, I asked, “Is your Heart-Wall made of metal that is harder than any metal that actually exists on earth? ”Her answer was definitive: “Yes.”


Wait a minute. What? How could her Heart-Wall be made of a metal that was harder than any metal that existed on earth?


#### Something Out of This World

I was so caught up in my concrete questions that I’d forgotten one very important fact.


----------


**The Heart-Wall is a creation of the subconscious mind – where literally anything is possible.**


----------


This wall is not physically made of any materials except the energy of a certain number of trapped emotions. It may not be “real” to us, but I believe that to the subconscious mind, although it is imaginary, it is also as real as anything else that exists in the world.

Its reality in the body is a very powerful one. That reality affects the systems of the body, just as our thoughts do. It has a direct influence on our health. But remember, the Heart-Wall is an imaginary construct – it can be made of literally anything at all.

Two years after Joanne was married, the abuse began. Her highest value was to keep her marriage together, so she stayed put.

Joanne had grown up in an idyllic and serene home, where she was cherished. According to Joanne, she could not remember her parents ever fighting, and the number of times that angry words were spoken could be counted on the fingers of one hand.

As the abuse increased in her marriage, her subconscious mind searched desperately for protection. Trapped emotions were being formed, so the raw materials were there to build a wall, but what kind of material would her subconscious mind consider to be tough enough to protect her heart from Nick’s abuse?

It is said that the subconscious mind does not distinguish between what we perceive to be either “reality” or “non-reality.” For example, if you see a movie that is very frightening, your subconscious mind doesn’t “know” that you are not actually experiencing the celluloid-reality of the movie. Sure enough, your heart will pound, your palms will sweat, and your biochemical reactions will be just the same. Adrenalin will course through your veins, and all the reactions that occur in a fight or flight situation will be the same as if your viewed reality is, indeed, reality itself.


Essentially, the subconscious mind treats everything that comes into it from your conscious mind as reality, whether it is or not. Which brings us back to Joanne, who has a Heart-Wall made of metal, but a certain kind of metal, stronger than any metal that exists on earth.

At some point, long ago, Joanne had seen an alien spaceship on a science fiction show. The Army fired missiles at it. When the smoke cleared, it was still there. They shot cannons at it – to no effect. They even launched a nuclear warhead at this alien spacecraft, but when the smoke cleared, it was still there. The scientists were stunned; the spacecraft was made of an entirely unknown substance, a metal that did not exist on earth, one that was apparently indestructible.


“Yes!” Her subconscious mind said, “That’s exactly what I need!” And this alien, make believe metal from an old sci-fi movie became her Heart-Wall construction material.

So Joanne had a Heart-Wall made of indestructible metal from an alien spacecraft. What better way to protect her heart? Remember, the Heart-Wall is from the deep imagination, from the subconscious mind of the person who unconsciously creates it.

Once we’d found out what it was made of at the metaphorical level, we began to release the trapped emotions that had been organized into this wall around Joanne’s heart.

Because she was still in this marriage with her abusive husband, we realized that her Heart-Wall had probably been a very important factor in her remaining married to Nick.

It had protected her heart all these years. Was removing the Heart-Wall the right thing to do? Was it the right thing for Joanne, at this point in her life? Her body had created the Heart-Wall for a reason, but there is always a price that you pay when you have a Heart-Wall, that price mainly being a diminished ability to feel.

We decided that the only safe route would be to ask her subconscious mind if it was okay to begin releasing these trapped emotions that were making up her Heart-Wall.

“Can we release a trapped emotion from your Heart-Wall now?” I asked.

Her body said “Yes.” It was okay to begin getting rid of these trapped emotions that were making up her Heart-Wall. In fact, Joanne’s body wanted them gone! So we began to clear them out, finding them one at a time through muscle testing.


Each time we would release a trapped emotion, we would re-check the thickness of the Heart-Wall, which we had initially found to be seven feet thick.

“Is the Heart-Wall still seven feet thick?” “No,” her body responded.

“Is it six feet thick?” “Yes.”

Again, with every trapped emotion we released, her Heart-Wall became thinner. The distance by which the Heart-Wall thickness diminished varied, depending on the emotion. Sometimes one released emotion would reduce the Heart-Wall by an entire foot. Other times, a released emotion would make less difference, resulting in a six-inch change or less. In Joanne’s case, there was no waiting period between releasing one emotion and the next; her subconscious mind was ready to release them all in a row, just as fast as we could find them and let them go.


#### Connecting the Dots

As we identified each trapped emotion, I also asked when that specific trapped emotion had become trapped. Asking that question helped Joanne connect the trapped emotions to specific events in her life that had caused her so much pain. We found that she did not have a Heart-Wall until the second year of her marriage, when things really started to become difficult.


As we traced back the origins of the individual trapped emotions, it was easy to see why Joanne had needed a Heart-Wall that was indestructible. One of her trapped emotions was from the time her husband had held a gun to his head and threatened to kill himself in front of her. Another trapped emotion was from the time that he fell into a fit of rage over her religious practices and literally burned her Bible in front of her. There were nine different emotions that had become trapped in her body, each of them having to do with some extreme experience with her husband, Nick.

#### Feeling Again With Her Heart

It took about thirty minutes to release all nine of these emotions and completely clear Joanne’s Heart-Wall. When her body indicated that the Heart-Wall was gone, Joanne smiled quietly.

“How are you feeling?” I asked her.

“A little dazed,” she said. “But good...” Then she went back home to Nick.


----------


**For twenty-two years, Joanne had an impenetrable wall around her heart. Now that the wall was gone, suddenly, she was able to feel in her heart all the barbs, all the meanness and all the venom that Nick heaped on her, from the moment she walked in the door.**


----------


For the first time in many years, she was really *feeling* what was going on in her relationship with Nick. Her Heart-Wall had been shielding her from the full force of his cruelty. Now that she could experience it for what it really was, without the protective wall, she couldn’t believe she’d stayed with him for so long. Who could tolerate this kind of abuse? And why should she put up with it anymore? Within two weeks she had left Nick for good, and filed for divorce.

Like so many of our body’s defenses, a Heart-Wall can be an invaluable safety measure in the short-term.

When something overwhelming happens, an emergency action can save your life.


----------


**If you’re being bombed, it’s a good idea to hide in a bunker. But you wouldn’t want to live there. If you did, you’d miss out on the joys and wonders of life.**


----------


The same is true with a Heart-Wall. No matter how important it was to your life at the time it was created, you will be able to live a happier, more connected life as soon as you can tear it down. Sometimes, it can make the difference between living a life of disappointment and living happily ever after.


#### Miranda and the Old Boyfriend

Miranda is a perfect example of how a Heart-Wall can interfere with your love life. She was an attractive 38-year-old nurse who came to me suffering from neck pain. During the course of the examination, she mentioned that she had not dated anyone in years and had no interest in having any kind of a relationship with men anymore. When I tested her, I was not surprised to find that she had a Heart-Wall.


Eight years before, Miranda’s heart had been broken in a relationship with a man she had deeply loved. In an effort to protect her heart from experiencing that kind of pain and injury again, her subconscious mind had created a Heart-Wall.

In Miranda’s case, three lingering emotions had been trapped in her body for all those years, blocking her from experiencing a loving relationship. She had no idea that these trapped emotions were the major underlying cause of the pain she was experiencing in her neck as well. Her neck pain had been going on for some time, and was considered chronic and even a bit mysterious by the other doctors she had consulted, as nothing seemed to relieve it.


One by one, we cleared each of these emotions. At the end, I asked her body if the Heart-Wall had finally been released. Her body said that it was completely gone.

I didn’t see Miranda again for about three months. When I did, she looked incredibly happy. I asked her what had changed and she excitedly said, “Everything!” She reported that her neck pain was long gone. But there was even better news than that.

“Right after I saw you last,” she said, “I ran into my childhood sweetheart. I hadn’t seen him since elementary school. But it turned out, he’d been living right around the corner from me – less than a block away – for almost eight years. We started dating and something really sparked between us. We’re in love! I think he’s going to ask me to marry him.” 

The woman who had come into my office complaining of neck pain and swearing off men was gone for good. She was like a completely new person.

“Thank you so much for helping me,” Miranda said. “If you hadn’t released my Heart-Wall, I honestly don’t think this would have happened. I was too closed-off before.”

When trapped emotions and Heart-Walls are released, people sometimes say it’s like they can finally feel again. They can give and receive love freely for the first time in a long time. In that state, very interesting and wonderful things can happen.


### How We Are Meant to Live

This is how we’re meant to live. We’re meant to live vibrant, healthy lives, filled with love and joy. Of all the emotions, love is the most pure and has the highest vibration. Love, that most powerful and most popular of all the emotions, is both *generated* by the heart and *received* by the heart.


----------


**When you have a Heart-Wall, you are not able to give love as well as you might, because that love energy that is in your heart cannot get out as well.**


----------


At the same time, love that is being radiated toward you by other people is blocked to some degree.

As a result, you can go through your life somewhat insulated from others, because of the emotional traumas you’ve been through and the subconscious wall that literally exists around your heart. The traumas were genuine enough and there is no doubt that they caused more pain than your body thought it could stand to feel again – that’s why the Heart-Wall made perfect sense at the time. But until you take it down, you’ll be trapped behind it to some degree, less able to reach out and connect with people, even the people you love most.


----------


**People’s lives and the lives of their children and their families have been completely transformed when their Heart-Walls have been removed.**


----------


About thirty percent of the time, the effects of releasing a Heart-Wall are very apparent and immediately noticeable, but most of the time the results are subtle, and the changes in a person’s life appear gradually, in ways that they themselves might not immediately recognize.


#### Paula and Her Angry Son

One day a woman named Paula came to my office with her son, Rick, who was 17 at the time. She told me that Rick was having problems with anger. He was hanging around with the wrong crowd and his grades were abysmal. She was afraid the next step might be drug use, and was looking to me for help. She had heard of our work with trapped emotions and was wondering if some of her son’s anger might be due to them.

I tested this very silent and angry young man and found that he had a Heart-Wall. When I tested his mother, I wasn’t too surprised to find that she had a Heart-Wall as well.

It quickly became apparent that Rick wasn’t the only one suffering from anger. His mother was also filled with anger and resentment toward her ex-husband, Rick’s father. She had a rather grim expression, and her jaw seemed to be set in a determined, angry clench.

It took 5 different sessions to clear Rick’s Heart-Wall, each session taking no more than 10 minutes or so. Sometimes he was able to release two emotions during a session, but most of the time, just one. His Heart-Wall trapped emotions all revolved around his birth father and how he had felt abandoned by him over the last few years. His parent’s divorce had been terribly difficult for him. He had trapped emotions of anger, frustration, resentment and feelings of inferiority, among other negative emotions.


As soon as we’d completed the process, Rick started to change. It was amusing to see that even his hairstyle changed. When I first met him, Rick had an orange Mohawk; in his case, an expression of his defiance. Without the need to express anger and resentment anymore, he went back to more ordinary hair. Not only that, but his grades improved by several levels. He had always been a smart boy, but he was blocking his emotions behind a Heart-Wall and the pressure had been building up for a long time.

Before we released his Heart-Wall, feelings of rage would well up inside of Rick when he thought of his father. After we cleared the Heart-Wall, Rick could think about his father – even spend time with him – and be completely okay. Now that his simmering anger was a thing of the past, Rick felt happier and more motivated. When he let go of the Heart-Wall, he got his life back.

I will never forget the last time I saw Rick, and how dramatically transformed he was. I remember him not being able to wipe the smile off his face as he told me about a recent fishing trip with his birth-father, and how much his relationship with him had changed.

Curiously enough, when we cleared his mother’s Heart-Wall, she didn’t seem to notice any change. About two months after we cleared her Heart-Wall, Paula came back to the office and complained to me, saying “What’s going on? Rick is like a completely new person. I hardly recognize him. But I don’t feel any different than I felt before!”


I explained that, when a Heart-Wall is removed, it often takes time for changes to be felt and for things to realign in your life.

The body has to go through a healing process once a Heart-Wall is removed, and that can take some time.

It was hard to tell whether she accepted that explanation or not. I think she was disappointed that her own life hadn’t changed as dramatically as Rick’s. I didn’t see either of them for a while and wondered on occasion how they were doing.

Then about a year later, I ran into Paula in a very upscale department store in Orange County. She recognized me and waited to see if I would recognize her. She looked familiar, but I had no idea who she was. As we talked, it dawned on me who she was, but she looked so completely different that I scarcely recognized her. Her face radiated happiness. Her whole demeanor had changed. Since we had last seen each other, she had not only gotten a wonderful job at this store, but had also found a wonderful man, and they were happily married.


As we talked, I found that Rick was continuing to do very well both in school and in life. I reminded her about her Heart-Wall and our conversation of a year before.

“I don’t know if having my Heart-Wall cleared had something to do with this or not,” she grinned, “but my life is so much better now than it was a year ago I can hardly believe it!”

As I walked away from that encounter, I remembered how deeply angry and unhappy she had been only a year before and I couldn’t help but wonder where she would be if we had not cleared her Heart-Wall. 


### Children and Heart-Walls

It’s a sad fact of life on this planet, that children often have Heart-Walls, too.


----------


**Think how tender and open a child’s heart is when they are little. They are helpless and trusting, and far too often, they are the victims of predatory or abusive adults and sometimes even cruel children. In these cases, Heart-Walls are always found.**


----------


Sometimes life is challenging even in wonderful homes and under the best of circumstances. The following letter is from a delightful woman whose son was diagnosed as being clinically depressed. After developing a trapped emotion while witnessing the death of a close friend, a Heart-Wall was formed to keep his poor little heart from entirely breaking.


#### Nine Years Old, and Depressed

> Dear Doctor Nelson,
> 
> Several weeks ago I brought my nine-year-old son to see you. He had
> been exhibiting unusual behavior. He was having difficulty eating,
> sleeping, and concentrating. He had become angry, negative and
> pessimistic. School was a nightmare! We tried urging, punishing,
> rewarding and bribing him to complete his school assignments. When
> they were finally completed he would not turn them into the teacher.
> He is a very intelligent boy yet his grades suffered because his
> assignments were not turned in.
> 
> 
> I set up an appointment with his pediatrician to be evaluated. We were
> then referred to a pediatric neurologist, and then to a psychologist
> for further review – they concluded that my son was depressed. (Two
> years ago my son witnessed the drowning of a very close friend and ten
> months later was whisked away to the funeral of his cousin. Four other
> relatives were buried within the next six months and I believe these
> events had a distressing effect on my son. I tried to help him cope
> with these events, but apparently they were still affecting him.)
> 
> When I brought him to see you, he was tested and you determined that
> he had a “Heart-Wall” causing an emotional imbalance in his body. The
> MagCreator was used to roll-out each of the negative emotions
> associated with the Heart-Wall. I do not understand all the scientific
> aspects of this type of treatment yet I believed I had finally found
> the answer to the growing problems with my son. After you worked on
> him he was a little lethargic for a couple of days, but the changes I
> noticed in his behavior in the weeks that followed were absolutely
> incredible!
> 
> 
> By the end of the first week he was sleeping and eating normally, and
> was once again happy and enthusiastic. He now completes every homework assignment without any nudging on my part.  Our home is much mor  pleasant – he is helpful, kind and patient. I feel like my sweet
> little boy has returned!
> 
> If skepticism had kept me away from this type of treatment, I would
> still be parenting a very sad and frustrated little boy with no
> solution in sight. Instead, I have found a treatment that has
> literally saved him. Thank you Dr. Nelson for all your help. Your
> knowledge and expertise in this field and your patience and concern
> have had a tremendous impact… My heartfelt gratitude to you for all
> that you have done to heal my son.
> 
> Thank you!! - (Name Withheld)

#### Little Jacob’s Heart-Wall

One of the most touching experiences I had with children is told by a young mother named Meisha. Her three year old son, Jacob had developed a Heart-Wall shortly after his birth and the death of his twin brother. I treated him and released his Heart-Wall in one visit, and later she wrote this testimonial for you to read.


> Three and a half years ago I gave birth to twin sons. Nine days
> following birth they contracted a virus, which ultimately attacked
> their hearts, leaving them in critical condition for two months.
> Jordan, the eldest twin, passed away due to multiple complications
> leaving Jacob, who then quickly recovered enough to come home but with continual problems with his heart.
> 
> Not only was Jacob left with heart failure, but with a Heart-Wall made
> from deep, lasting emotions that were manifested in excessive anger,
> destructiveness, unhappiness, insecurity and aggression. A day or two
> following treatment my tender hearted son was back. Friends would
> comment on how happy he appeared. He was helpful and kind, patient and pleasant. His behavior was polar opposite from when his heavy emotions were weighing him down. I know through continued treatments my dear son will be emotionally healed and allowed to live the happy life that he is entitled to.
> -Meisha E., Texas

As news of our discovery of the Heart-Wall spread, other practitioners began to come to us for training, although the majority of attendees continued to be lay-people. The following Heart-Wall story was submitted by Gwen Legler, a counselor in Washington State.

#### The Hated Heart-Wall

> I have found that people usually choose a Heart-Wall substance that
> has a positive memory or image for them. That is why I was so
> surprised with Pearl’s negative reaction to her Heart-Wall made of
> Rhododendron bushes. She hated rhododendrons and couldn’t believe her
> subconscious chose them. I double-checked, and it was correct. I found
> it interesting that her body would not let me identify her Heart-Wall
> until the third visit, and then it would only let me remove a few
> emotions. It was definitely protecting her from something. I suggested
> we continue and maybe we would understand why.
> 
> By the fifth visit we began to remove more emotions – guilt,
> heartache, hatred, betrayal, grief, and so on. It soon became apparent
> that her Heart-Wall was like a storage unit for one particular
> incident in her life. About 16 years ago she had an extramarital
> affair for which she felt extreme guilt and self-loathing. Although
> she stopped and never had another affair and was forgiven by her
> husband, she couldn’t seem to forgive herself and put it behind her.
> Now we realized her Heart-Wall was a bush she hated because it
> contained an experience she hated. We cleared the Heart-Wall and she
> found peace and was able to forgive herself.
> 
> -Gwen L., Washington

#### The Ring Dream

Pat and her husband Jim attended the first seminar that I taught, which was held in San Diego in 1996. I received this letter from them about their experience with a recurring nightmare that was being caused by a Heart-Wall.


> I wanted to share my experiences with Heart-Walls with you. Jimmy and
> I attended a seminar in San Diego with you, where you explained
> Heart-Walls, how to find them, and break through them.
> 
> My daughter died in 1987, and after a while I began having a recurring
> nightmare that we called “The Ring Dream.” Nancy had loved rings, so I
> always connected the dream with her. I would wake up hysterical and
> screaming, clutching my hands looking for my rings. I could never
> remember what caused the panic, or why it was so important to find my
> rings.
> 
> After we attended your seminar, we decided to check me for a
> Heart-Wall. Needless to say, we found one! We worked back through the
> years, clearing the layers of trapped emotions as we went. At two
> years of age, I had a trapped emotion of abandonment. As I had always
> been with my family, I did not quite believe what the testing was
> showing. I told my mother about the Heart-Wall, and the abandonment
> emotion. She told me that when I was two, she had left me with my
> grandmother and had gone to stay with my father at an Army camp. My
> grandmother had said for her to go, that she would take care of me,
> that I was just a baby and wouldn’t miss my mother. It was a story
> that I had never heard before, but it had left its impression on me
> when I was 2 years old.
> 
> Jimmy and I worked together and cleared all the trapped emotions that
> were making up my Heart-Wall. What a relief it was to us to discover
> that the dream stopped, and did not return. While we both felt we
> learned a lot at your seminar, nothing compared to the joy we felt we
> received when that horrible dream stopped.
> 
> I appreciate the opportunity to share this with you. We have shared
> this story with other people we have met, but I’m glad to finally be
> able to tell you about it. Thank you so much for this wonderful
> program.
> 
> -Pat S., Louisiana

### Finding and Releasing the Heart-Wall

Now let’s talk about how you can actually determine if a person has a Heart-Wall, and how you can release it.


----------


**To find a Heart-Wall, you simply ask. Unless you actually *ask* the person’s subconscious mind if they have a Heart-Wall, it will not be revealed.**


----------


The Heart-Wall is made of trapped emotions, but the subconscious mind no longer categorizes them as such. These emotions are now part of a wall and are inaccessible until you ask if there is a Heart-Wall. You have to get the mindbody to admit that there is a wall, before you can get to the trapped emotions that are creating it. Once you do that, the trapped emotions once again become recognizable to the subconscious mind as trapped emotions, and therefore, are vulnerable to being released. As you release them, one by one, the wall will come down.

It’s really simple. Ask, “Do you have a Heart-Wall?” Then use the muscle test of your choice to get the body’s response.


----------


**My experience is that about 80% of the general public will test positive for a Heart-Wall.**


----------


#### Use of the Word “Hidden”

When you ask, “Do you have a Heart-Wall?” and the answer is no, there might be another phenomenon at work. Quite often, the Heart-Wall will actually be hidden and will not show up unless you actually use the word “hidden” in your question or statement. The whole purpose of the Heart-Wall is to protect one’s heart, or in other words, to *hide* the heart from those who might do it emotional harm. It seems that sometimes the Heart-Wall gets a bit too hidden t o readily detect, but if you expressly use the word “hidden” when you ask, it will show up.


To check for this possibility, simply add the word “hidden” to your question or statement. For example, you could ask, “Do you have a *Hidden* Heart-Wall?” If they have one, and it’s hidden, it will be revealed.

It’s important to remember this tip. I can’t tell you how often I’ve had to use the word “hidden” to find Heart-Walls that would otherwise not have been detectable.


----------


**A *hidden* Heart-Wall is not a different kind of Heart-Wall. It’s simply a Heart-Wall that is a bit more difficult to find.**


----------


Once the body has opened up to you, to let you know that a hidden Heart-Wall is there, you can proceed without having to use the word hidden anymore, because it’s no longer hidden.

#### Is it Ready to Be Released?

Once you have determined that a Heart-Wall is present, ask “Can we release an emotion from the Heart-Wall now?” The Heart-Wall is there for a reason, and while ultimately the effects of having a Heart-Wall are negative to the health and well-being of the individual, some people are in situations where they simply are not ready or willing to give up the protection of the Heart-Wall for now, and you need to respect that.


If a Heart-Wall is present, but you get a negative response about removing it, your subject may want to meditate on why the subconscious mind is giving that answer. Is it unsafe, or are they already processing some other things that are taxing the mindbody? At any rate, it is important to listen to their subconscious. It knows what is best for them. 

If you get a yes answer to your question, you then simply follow the same process outlined in chapter six and follow it. For your convenience, there is a flowchart on page 278 that is specifically for releasing Heart-Walls.


The Emotion Code works the same way to release trapped emotions whether they are part of a Heart-Wall or not. When you ask, “Can we release an emotion from the Heart-Wall now?” and you get a positive answer, the mindbody has a particular emotion in mind that it is willing to release.


----------


**You don’t get to choose which emotion will be released first; the subconscious mind of the subject will do that.**


----------


As soon as you receive a yes answer to this question, the trapped emotion has already been chosen. All you need to do now is determine which emotion it is on the chart, in order to bring it to conscious awareness. Identify it, determine any other information that the subconscious wants the conscious mind to know about it, and then release it.

#### Time to Process May be Needed

As I’ve explained previously, sometimes you will be able to release all the trapped emotions that are making up a Heart-Wall one after another, in one concentrated effort. At other times, the body will allow you to release a limited number of trapped emotions before needing to take time out to process what has been released, requiring from a few hours to a day or more before you can release another one.

After verifying the release of a trapped emotion from the Heart-Wall, you simply return to your original question and ask, “Can we release an emotion from the Heart-Wall now?” If the answer is yes, and if you have the time, keep going.


If the answer is no, you may want to check to see if perhaps the Heart-Wall is gone, by asking again, if they have a Heart-Wall. If they still have one, ask when you can release the next emotion – later today, in an hour, tomorrow, etc.


### Determining the Heart-Wall Material

Remember that the subconscious mind is very logical. Since it is patently illogical to have a “wall” made of nothing, the subconscious mind will always choose a material for the Heart-Wall to be made of.

You don’t really *need* to know what substance the subconscious mind chose to build the Heart-Wall out of in order to release it. Ultimately, all Heart-Walls are made of the energy of trapped emotions, and releasing these trapped emotions is what really matters.

On the other hand, determining the material that has been chosen is interesting because of the symbolism that is often revealed. There is no right or wrong way to ask what material has been used, but I usually start by asking if the material is wood. If it isn’t wood, I ask if it is a material harder or softer than wood. If it is harder than wood, I may ask if it is made from metal, etc. You can narrow it down pretty quickly using the process of deduction, and you’ll get some great practice using muscle testing.


If you have determined what material the Heart-Wall is made of, you might then want to ask how thick the Heart-Wall is. They can range in thickness from paper-thin to *many* miles! All I can tell you is that this is what we have found in testing. Our subconscious minds are not limited like our conscious minds are, and can have quite an imagination! Yet I believe that the subconscious mind takes it all quite seriously, and really does believe that there is a wall there, made of whatever material has been chosen.


#### Heart-Wall Metaphors

An older couple came to see me. The husband was very grouchy, and was dismissive and gruff with his wife. She seemed to be a very gentle soul. They both had Heart-Walls. His was made of solid steel, cold and hard, miles thick. Hers was many thousands of layers of curtain material, providing a nice cushion against his toxic personality.


A gay man had a Heart-Wall made of solid diamond, which is the hardest known naturally occurring material. Incidentally, his subconscious would not allow me to release this wall.

I’ve seen Heart-Walls made of flowers, quilts, blankets, earth, stones, vegetation, leather, glass, all kinds of metals such as steel, titanium, and iron, as well as various construction materials such as logs, concrete blocks, bricks, and so on.


Quite often there will be a noticeable relevance between the personality of an individual and their Heart-Wall material. I treated a young child once who had a Heart-Wall made of yellow plastic, just like her little yellow plastic toys.


----------


**Sometimes Heart-Walls will have a door or a window. Often the door will be locked, and nobody has the key but the owner.**


----------


While often a Heart-Wall is spherical, they can be box shaped, or any other shape you can imagine. Sometimes they have sharp edges or projections on their surface to keep people out.

One young man couldn’t seem to form close attachments with women, although he was very handsome, had everything else going for him, and had many opportunities.

I found that his Heart-Wall was made of a one-way mirror, which allowed him to see out, but no one else to see in.

I once treated a child whose most common expression was “I can’t!” I found and released his Heart-Wall. It was made from a single piece of paper. On it were the words, “I can’t!” His parents commented that after his Heart-Wall was released, he no longer felt that he couldn’t do things, and was happier and more positive. He also stopped whining and saying “I can’t!”


### Anne Horne’s Story

A woman named Anne Horne wrote from Seattle to tell me of a remarkable near-death experience she had, in which she saw people in the future, helping others remove their Heart-Walls. Here, in her own words, is her story, or see the video at this link:

[healerslibrary.com/news/anne-hornes-near-death-experience/](http://www.healerslibrary.com/news/anne-hornes-near-death-experience/)

> Dear Dr. Nelson-
> 
> I originally came into contact with your work when a practitioner here
> in Seattle named Marguerite used your techniques to balance my body.
> At the end of the session, Marguerite turned around and just as an
> afterthought said, “Oh, let’s see if you have a Heart-Wall...”
> 
> “What is a Heart-Wall?” I said. “I don’t understand.”
> 
> 
> And she said, “That’s okay. You don’t have to know what it is. I’ll
> just test you for it.”
> 
> So she did, and I didn’t have one.
> 
> Then she said, “Let’s test you for a hidden Heart-Wall.”
> 
> “All right,” I said. “But what is it?”
> 
> “That’s okay,” she said, smiling. “You don’t have to understand.”
> 
> She checked me for a hidden Heart-Wall, but I didn’t have one of those
> either. Then she explained how emotions can put up a wall between
> yourself and others around your heart. When she found a Heart-Wall,
> she would run a magnet down a person’s back to release those emotions
> and open their hearts.
> 
> I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. It was like an electric bolt
> went through me. Suddenly, an event that had happened to me
> twenty-five years ago made sense. It was the realization of a very

> 
> When I was 23, I died. It was a violent death. I had one of those
> near-death experiences that 10 million other people have also

> 
> It was a very important experience for me. I left my body and had a
> life review. I was a young thing and hadn’t done anything particularly
> exciting or big. But I was going back, home, and on my way, there was
> a light, a tunnel. I felt like I was being pulled by my heart toward a
> wonderful place. In that moment, I was encompassed by all this innate
> intelligence and tremendous love. And I just wanted to go home. It was
> fantastic.
> 
> I found myself facing this man who was standing in front of me – we

> 
> I said, “But I want to go home.”
> 
> He turned away from me and I could see him conferring with someone

> 
> And suddenly, I realized where we were, because we looked down, and

> see the earth below us. We were looking at the Americas, specifically
> the West Coast of North America. We were looking at the Northwest

> 
> Now, I’m from Virginia and I died in North Carolina. At 23 years old,

> 
> “Are we nurses?” I asked him.

> At that moment, the people doing this work became consciously aware of each another. It wasn’t something planned, it wasn’t some kind of

### Counting the Cost

The price we pay for having Heart-Walls is incalculable. How many people have led disconnected and lonely lives due to the walls around their hearts? How many people have not experienced the joy of finding love in their lives? How many wives and children have been abused?


Heart-Walls can lead to depression, divorce, and abuse. The patterns of abuse that are created can pass from generation to generation, causing all manner of pain and destructive behavior.


----------


**The result of Heart-Walls on a larger scale leads to misunderstanding, prejudice, hatred and brutality. On a global scale, Heart-Walls lead to ethnic cleansing, nation against nation, terrorism, and war.**


----------


There is altogether too much of isolation and violence, too much of sorrow and pain in this world. When I walk down the street, I see so many people with tight, clenched jaws like Paula had or boys with angry, resentful expressions, acting out their pain and frustration any way they can. The news is filled every night with one story after another about people whose hearts must be barricaded behind strong walls for them to do the things they do.


Widespread depression is another common side effect of Heart-Walls and trapped emotions. In the United States alone, it is estimated that between 13 and 14 million people suffer from depression. It is the leading cause of disability in American women. Nearly 15 percent of those women will ultimately commit suicide. Among children and young adults – between 10 and 24 years old – suicide is the third leading cause of death. By releasing trapped emotions and removing Heart-Walls, we have seen cases of severe depression eliminated once and for all. We have seen marriages saved, abuse stopped, and lives turned around. We’ve seen beautiful, loving relationships begin. We’ve seen kids make better choices. We’ve seen peace restored.


I am so grateful to be able to share what I have learned about trapped emotions and Heart-Walls, and to be able to bring this information to light. There is no doubt in my mind that it comes from above, and is meant to bless many lives in these times that are so trying in so many ways. I feel so blessed to have been led to discover a method that has such a powerfully transformative effect on people’s lives. It’s an exciting thing to be a part of.


If you have a Heart-Wall, can you see how important it is for you to clear that wall away? Can you see the importance of helping your own children and your own family? Can you see how transformational it would be if we could do the same thing for the whole world? Imagine how this world will change when we can open enough people’s hearts to create a critical mass. As in Anne’s near-death experience, that critical mass, perhaps only thousands of us, will be enough to help transform this planet forever. Those whose hearts are open will be the anchors for that divine energy that will transform and heal the world.
*Imagine.*
